Serial No. 139,2790. (No model To all whom/it may concern:  \n Be it known that I, RICHARD H. HAM, iof  \n ,Stockportnnthe countyof Columbia and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in \u0026#39;lrolley-Retractors;` andl do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the inven-` tion, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains toin ake and use the same. i  \n  The primary object of this invention is to provide a trolley-retractor for carrying a trolley-catcher, so that the weight of .the latter may be utilized to aid in retracting the trolley.  \n Trolley-catchers are, as is well known, de-  \n By-my invention as soon as \u0026#39;this occurs the retractor is freed and sofacts upon the catcher and trolley that the wheel is immediately\u0026#39; brought back beneath the wire.  \n  The invention will be hereinafter fully set forth, `and particularly pointed out in the claims. n  \n  In the accompanying\u0026#39;drawings, Figure l is a longitudinal sectional view. Fig. 2 is a plan view with parts broken away.` Fig. 3 is an end view. Fig. 4 shows a portion of the face# plate and retractor-arm removed.  \n  Referring to the drawings, 1 designates a `boxing or casing openfat its front and ends and designed to be secured-\u0026#39;in an upright position to the dashboard of a. trolley-car. EX- tending transversely of the lowerend of the casing and mounted in the sides thereof is a shaft 2, designed to form a bearing for the hub 3 of a retractor-arm 4. The hub is shown in the form of a U -shape plate having co- 4 incident openings 5 in its laterals 6 to accom- Inodate the shaft, the retractor-arrn being integral with or \u0026#39;secured to the central body portion 7 Around shaft 2 are coiled the\u0026#39;ends of a spring 8,1 which are secured to ratchetwheels 9, loosely mounted on the shaft. The central portion of the spring bears against the inner side of the retractor-arm. This oentralportion may beV divided, as when two springs instead of one areemployed Pawls 10 engage the ratchet-wheels to prevent their The ratchet-wheels may be turned to increase the spring tension.  \n The retractor-arin is in the form of an ap proximately rectangular frame 12, which is designed to be freely moved into and out of the casing\u0026#39;. The outer face-plate 13 is of increased thickness to forma tenon-block 14 of the` widthof, but less in length than, theopening inthe retractor-arm, a bow-spring 15 be tween the end of the block and the outer end of the arm serving to normally hold the block against the lower end of the frame. The outer edges of the face-plate are \u0026#39;designed to be normally seated against the sides of the\u0026#39; casing.  \n  16 designates the locking-plate mounted on the inner side of frame 12 and movable longi tudinally thereof, together with the face plate, to which it is secured by screws 17 At its upper or outerend the plate 16 is pro p `vided with a hook 18, shown in the forni of a lateral shoulder channeled or grooved on its` under face. This hook is curved or rounded, so that when forced against a locking-bar 19 it will Vride upwardly thereon, and upon passing to the inner side thereof the plates 13-and 16 will be free to move downwardly -under the recoil of spring 15, and thus be locked within the casing.  \n  2O designates `the trolley-catcher of the form in common use. It is designed to be secured to the faceplate, on the outside there of, and to have secured thereto the rope 21, Afast at itsV other end to the trolley.  \n 2Z\u0026#39;de\u0026#39;signates the buffer designed to corn` tact witha\u0026#39;spring 23\u0026#39;to prevent damage to` the\u0026#39;device or the car in the event of the former being released when the rope is not secured to the trolley.  \n  In practice with the car running under normal conditions the retraotor is held Within -the casing by bar 19 against the tension of spring 8, the two plates 13 and 16 being held at the lower end of frame 12 under the ten sion of spring 15, although obviously the plates 13 and 16 to move upwardly, thereby ICO disengaging hook 1S from bar 19 and allow- \\ing the retractor-arm under the recoil of spring 8 and the weight of the catcher to instantly swing outwardly, drawing the trolley beneath the wire and precluding the possibility of its coming Vin contact with the arms by which the latter is supported. As soon as the trolley-wheel is replaced in engagement with the conductor-wire an inward swing of the retractorarln will cause hook 18 to reengage bar 19, and thus hold the arm locked, as before, with the trolley-catcher in proper position. y  \n  .The advantages of my invention are apparent.  \n The device is simple in construction and operation and free of complicated mechanism.  \n  It is obvious that various forms of trolleycatchers as generally used may readily be secured to a retrantor constructed in accordf ance with my invention, so that the pull on weight of the catcher serving to swing the retractor when the latter is rel-eased, as s\u0026#39;et forth. f  \n  2. In combination, a trolley-catcher and a trolley-retractor, the latter comprising a movable member to which the trolley-catcher is secured, and means for normally holding such member looked, such means being\u0026#39; actuated to release said member and permit the\u0026#39; such arm locked, and a spring acting on such arm, -said trolley-catcher being mounted on said arm, said locking means being disengaged upon a pull being exerted on the catcher, and said arm being thereby swung outwardly under the recoil of said spring and the weight of the catcher, substantially as set forth.  \n 4. In a trolley-retractin g device, in combination, a pivoted retractor-arm, means tending to swing` said arm in one direction, a locking-plate in sliding engagement with said arm designed to normallyhold thelatter as against the tension of said swinging means, and a trolley-catcher m ounted on the retractor-arm, substantially as set forth.  \n 5. In a trolley-retracting device, in combi nation, a pivoted retractor-arm, and means tending to swing said arm in one direction, a locking-plate in sliding engagement with said arm to normally hold the latterv as against the tension of said swinging means, a face-plate secured to and movable with said lockingplate, and connections between said faceplate and the trolley, substantially as set forth.  \n 6. In a trolley-retracting device, in combination, a pivoted retractor-arm having an open frame, a spring tending to swing said arm in one direction, aface-plate movable in said frame, a looking-plate secured to and movable with said face-plate and tending to normally hold said arm as against the tension of said spring, and connections between said face-plate and the trolley, as set forth.  \n  7 In a trolley-retracting device, the combination with a casing having an open front and ends, and a shaft and locking-bar mounted, respectively, in the lower and upper ends of said casing, of a retractor-arm mounted on said shaft\u0026#39;, a spring tending to swingsaid arm outwardly from said casing, a sliding locking member in engagement with said arm having a hook at its upper end designed to normally engage said locking-bar, and connections be- .tween said locking member and the trolley,  \n IOO  \n outwardly from said casing, said arm earrying an open frame, a face-plate on the outer side of said arm with a tenon fitted within said frame, a locking-plate secured to and movable with said face-plate on the inner side of said arm, a spring tending to hold vsaid locking-plate at the lower end of said frame, a shoulder on the upper fend of said lockingplate designed to normallyengage said locking-bar, the outer face of said shoulder being rounded, and a trolley-catcher mounted on said face-plate and connected to the trolley, substantially as set forth.  \n  In testimony whereof I have signed this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \n RICHARD H.

Serial No. 130,110. (No model.)  \n To all whom it may concern:  \n Be it known that I, AMANDUs J OHANN AU- GUST\u0026#39;OESTERREICH, a citizen of the German .Empire, residing at Hamburg, Germany, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Sewing-Machine Hemmers, of which the following is a specification, reference being. had therein to the accompanying drawings.  \n  In the use of sewing machine hemmers making a wide fold or hem for hemstitching it is essential that the work should be guided to the stitch-formic g devices with great accuracy, particularly where the hems run across 1 each other, as in the corners of handkerchiefs, table-cloths, \u0026amp;c., and the hemmers heretofore in use could not always be depended on for accurate work.  \n  This invention has for its object to provide asewing-machinehemmeradapted formaking folds or hems of different widths and which will present the goods to the stitching devices smoothly and accurately.  \n In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a sectional elevation of the improved hemmer in operative relation to parts of a sewingmachine, but with the movable part of the hemmer adjustable laterally for the insertion of the work. Fig. 2 is a sectionalview of the hemmer with the parts in working position. Fig. 3 is a plan view of the hemmer and a part of the work-plate of the sewing-machine, showing also the work. Fig. 4 is a side view of the hemmer looking from right of. Fig. 1,  \n but with the interchangeable guiding-plate removed. Fig. 5 illustrates a guiding-plate of different width from that shown in Figs.  \n 1, 2, and\u0026#39;3.  \n Referring to the drawings, a denotes part 7 of the depending head of a sewing-machine,  \n  tue of the slot h, through which the set-screw f passes, as will be understood.  \n  Mounted on the plate g is a block 2\u0026#39;, having a raised tongue 70, which serves as a guide for the left-hand edge of the hem-fold, and attached toa sliding bar 052, mounted in ways on the plate (Z, is a cap n, which when in the working position (shown by Figs. 2 and 3) em braces the tongue 7c. The sliding barm is provided with a pin 0, embraced by a forked lever p, by which the cap n may be\u0026#39;adjusted to the different positions shown in Figs. 1 and 2, either for the convenient insertion of the work or for the hemming operation. A detent-spring q,\u0026#39;attached to the lower face of the lever p and having apointed free end to enter slight indentations r in the plated, serves to hold the said lever in the difierent positions to which it may be moved.  \n  The guiding-plate s, which serves to form the right-hand edge of the hem-fold and around whichthe fabric passing beneath the plate 9 is folded, is removably supported in the said plate g. To hold the said guidingplate 3 in place, said plate is provided with a longitudinal groove f entered by a frictionspring or spring-tongue u beneath the undercut right-hand part of the block \u0026#39;L\u0026#39;. This construction permits a guiding-plate 8 to be removed and another interchangeable guidingplate of different width to be substitutedtherefor in making hems of different widths.  \n  In the use of the attachment the cap 91. may be shifted to the left, as shown in Fig. 1, when the work is to be inserted, and is then shifted back to the working position. (Shown in Figs. 2 and 3.) By reference to Fig. 3 it will be seen that the hem-fold in the fabric 00 overlies the guiding-plate s and the block 21, so that the goods are so disposed that when inserting the same in the hemmer the attendant can gently press them into place with the finger instead of being required to use a pointed instrument for this purpose, as with some hemmers heretofore in use, while the construction of the device is such that the hem is guided smoothly and accurately to the stitch-forming devices of the machine.  \n Having thus described my invention, I  \n claim and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States- 1. A sewing-machine hemmer comprising a tongue, as k, for guiding the left-hand edge of the hem fold and a removable and inter changeable guiding-plate, as s, for the right: hand ed ge of the fold, combined with a movable cap, as n, embracing said tongue, a slide by which said cap is carried, an adj listing-lever for said slide, means for holding said leverin different positions of adjustment, and means for supporting said parts from the head of a sewing-machine and above the work-plate thereof.  \n  2. The combination with the arm 0, of the plate d, adjustably connected therewith, the plate 9 attached to said plate d and provided with the block 1\u0026#39; having the guiding-tongue 7c,","language":"en","truncated":false}],"description_localized_html":[{"text":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e' No. 739,210.

(No model.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo all whom it may concern: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe it known that I, AMANDUs J OHANN AU- GUST'OESTERREICH, a citizen of the German .Empire, residing at Hamburg, Germany, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Sewing-Machine Hemmers, of which the following is a specification, reference being. had therein to the accompanying drawings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the use of sewing machine hemmers making a wide fold or hem for hemstitching it is essential that the work should be guided to the stitch-formic g devices with great accuracy, particularly where the hems run across 1 each other, as in the corners of handkerchiefs, table-cloths, \u0026amp;c., and the hemmers heretofore in use could not always be depended on for accurate work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention has for its object to provide asewing-machinehemmeradapted formaking folds or hems of different widths and which will present the goods to the stitching devices smoothly and accurately. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a sectional elevation of the improved hemmer in operative relation to parts of a sewingmachine, but with the movable part of the hemmer adjustable laterally for the insertion of the work. Fig. 2 is a sectionalview of the hemmer with the parts in working position. Fig. 3 is a plan view of the hemmer and a part of the work-plate of the sewing-machine, showing also the work. Fig. 4 is a side view of the hemmer looking from right of. Fig. 1, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut with the interchangeable guiding-plate removed. Fig. 5 illustrates a guiding-plate of different width from that shown in Figs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1, 2, and'3. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferring to the drawings, a denotes part 7 of the depending head of a sewing-machine, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e tue of the slot h, through which the set-screw f passes, as will be understood. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Mounted on the plate g is a block 2', having a raised tongue 70, which serves as a guide for the left-hand edge of the hem-fold, and attached toa sliding bar 052, mounted in ways on the plate (Z, is a cap n, which when in the working position (shown by Figs. 2 and 3) em braces the tongue 7c. The sliding barm is provided with a pin 0, embraced by a forked lever p, by which the cap n may be'adjusted to the different positions shown in Figs. 1 and 2, either for the convenient insertion of the work or for the hemming operation. A detent-spring q,'attached to the lower face of the lever p and having apointed free end to enter slight indentations r in the plated, serves to hold the said lever in the difierent positions to which it may be moved. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The guiding-plate s, which serves to form the right-hand edge of the hem-fold and around whichthe fabric passing beneath the plate 9 is folded, is removably supported in the said plate g. To hold the said guidingplate 3 in place, said plate is provided with a longitudinal groove f entered by a frictionspring or spring-tongue u beneath the undercut right-hand part of the block 'L'. This construction permits a guiding-plate 8 to be removed and another interchangeable guidingplate of different width to be substitutedtherefor in making hems of different widths. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the use of the attachment the cap 91. may be shifted to the left, as shown in Fig. 1, when the work is to be inserted, and is then shifted back to the working position. (Shown in Figs. 2 and 3.) By reference to Fig. 3 it will be seen that the hem-fold in the fabric 00 overlies the guiding-plate s and the block 21, so that the goods are so disposed that when inserting the same in the hemmer the attendant can gently press them into place with the finger instead of being required to use a pointed instrument for this purpose, as with some hemmers heretofore in use, while the construction of the device is such that the hem is guided smoothly and accurately to the stitch-forming devices of the machine. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving thus described my invention, I \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclaim and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States- 1. A sewing-machine hemmer comprising a tongue, as k, for guiding the left-hand edge of the hem fold and a removable and inter changeable guiding-plate, as s, for the right: hand ed ge of the fold, combined with a movable cap, as n, embracing said tongue, a slide by which said cap is carried, an adj listing-lever for said slide, means for holding said leverin different positions of adjustment, and means for supporting said parts from the head of a sewing-machine and above the work-plate thereof. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 2.

In stretching the spring while placing the eyeglasses in position on the nose the glasses will make a movement in the plane perpendicular to the plane of the glasses, either forwarder sidewise or both ways, but will not make a rotary movement around theiry optical centers. This is of importance where cylinders or prismatic glasses are used in combination or not with spherical glasses. In-  \n stead of the usual band -spring a helical spring has sometimes been used in combinag tion with and dependent upon a guiding-bar in order to connect the two glasses and enable them to be placed upon the nose without making a rotary movement toward one another. The glasses in this case approach one another in a straight line and remain alw. ys in one plane.  \n  According to my invention I employ a spring `the form and mode of application of which insure the same results in a simpler manner with additional advantages. In the accompanying drawings the spring b possesses elasticity only in a plane perpendicular, or nearly so, to that of the glasses. This ela-sticity is obtained by the hoop or bow shape of parallel position of the flat surface of a band spring to the surface of the glasses a. The result is that the glasses can only be moved in a plane more or less perpendicular to them- \u0026#34;selves, but cannot make a rotary movement\u0026#39;4 and in using cylindrical glasses or the like\u0026#39;the direction of their axes will remain in the same position notwithstanding the displacement of the glasses out of their position relatively to `the horizontal and \u0026#39;vertical medium lines of the\u0026#39;eyes. Anotheradvantage of this construction is that the spring may be fastened to the sides of the eyeglass or its frame instead of upon their periphery.  \n Having thus fully described my invention,  \n \u0026#39;l claim the following features as my inven- 2.

SCOTT, OF NEWBURG, OI-IIO.  \n PROCESS OF TREATING GARBAGE.  \n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent N0. 742,226, dated October 27, 1903.  \n Application filedDccember 1,1902. Serial No. 133.340. (No specimens.)  \n To all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that we, ERNEST S. PEOK and WALTER M. Soorr, citizens of the United States, and residents of Newburg, county of Ouyahoga, and State of Ohio, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Processes of Treating Garbage, of which the following is a specification, the principle of the invention being\u0026#39;hereinexplained and the best mode in which we have contemplated applying that principle, so as to distinguish it from other inventions.  \n  Our improved process relates to methods of treating garbage, its object being to recover therefrom all the valuable ingredients contained therein in an economical and efficient manner. Heretofore in processes of this character a large part of the desirable material has been lost, due to the imperfect or usually total lack of utilization of those liquid products which contain this material in solution. It is the remedy of this imperfection that is the especial object of this invention.  \n  Said improved process consists of steps hereinafter fully described, and specifically set forth in the claims.  \n  The annexed drawings illustrate one form of apparatus for carrying out our said process, the disclosed form, however, constituting but one of various forms of apparatus which may be used in carrying out the principle of said invention.  \n  In said annexed drawings, Figure I represents a vertical section of said apparatus, and Fig. II represents a horizontal section of same.  \n  A digester is provided and comprises a cylindrical receptacle A, provided with a dou; ble shell forming a surrounding steam-jacket a. This jacket communicates with a chamber a, formed at the bottom of the\u0026#39;receptacle A between a diaphragm a and a head a Upon the middle of the diaphragm a is supported a steam-dome B, closed at the top and open at the bottom to communicate with chamber d. A discharge-pipe C connects with an opening in the bottom\u0026#39;of chamber a, which discharges into a steam-trap D. This trap is preferably connected with the boiler used for generating the steam utilized in our process. The top of the receptacle is provided with jacket ct.  \n  an opening a and a door A, forming an airtight closure therewith, and an opening d which is connected to a pipe or conduit E, containing a valve e for cutting off communication with the interior of the receptacle. This conduit E is connected with a condens iug or vacuum pump. (Not shown.)  \n  A steam-supply pipe F connects with and supplies steam from a suitable source and at a suitable pressure to the interior of the An\u0026#39; air-tight door A is provided for removing the solid matter from the receptacles interior and forms an air-tight closure with an opening at.  \n  A safety-valve a is placed at a convenient position, such as in the conduit E, asshown, and arranged to blow off at about fifty pounds pressure. Beneath the receptacle A and communicating with the same by means of a coil G, provided with perforations g g, is the pipe H, connected to a suitable source of hot air or superheated steam, whereby thelatter may be forced up through the contents of the receptacle. The said pipe H is provided with a valve h, whereby communication between the receptacle A and the said pipe may be cut off.  \n  In carrying out our processthe garbage and a quantity of-liquid which has been expressed from the tankage of previous cookings are introduced into the digester through the opening a. Inasmuch as some liquid material must necessarily be introduced into the digester before the garbage can be cooked, it is of great advantage to have this liquid consist of the garbage-saturated water expressed from the tankage of previous cookings, for in such water there is much valuable material which can be thus saved in an economical manner, and, furthermore, it obviates the inconvenience and expense of later removing a large amount of moisture, which must necessarily be done when clear water is used as the auxiliary means for cooking. The opening a is then tightly closed and the valve e shut to out off communication through conduit E. The digester is thus rendered\u0026#39; air-tight. \u0026#39;Steam is now admitted into the interior of the receptacle by means of the coil, thereby thoroughly heating the garbage. After such heating has been effected the steam is preferably shutoff from the coil. This prior cooking by direct heat greatly facilitates the subsequent process of cooking the garbage by radiated heat and reduces time of completing such cooking operation. Steam being admitted into the jacket a and the dome B, the garbage is now thoroughly cooked by radiated heat, while thus excluded from the atmosphere. This cooking converts part of the uncombined and combined water into vapor, the remainder becoming very highly heated. When the cooking has progressed sufliciently, the valve c is opened, whereupon the vaporous content of the digester is exhausted from its interior by means of the condensing or vacuum pump. Such vaporous content, as well as all of the free water, which now is given an opportunity to volatilize by reason of the constant vacuum produced in the receptacle by the continuous withdrawing of the vapors and by reason of the high temperature maintained in the receptacle by the steam which is still heating the jacket, is thus removed without removing any of the solid matter in the receptacle. By free water we mean the liquid contents of the receptacle which contain none of the oleaginous matter nor of the garbage, which water would normally drain slowly off from the tankage and which does not adhere to the garbage with enough pertinacity to require mechanical pressure to separate it from the same. Our method of exhausting expeditiously and eltectively removes this part of the liquid content. Although such part of the liquid might be removed by the compression to which the garbage is subjected after the cooking, still by the method of exhausting nearly all of the undesirable material is thus disposed of during and immediately following the time of cooking, and the subsequent operation of evaporating down to stick that part of the liquid product which is pressed out of the tankage is made much shorter and more economical. Should the pressure in the receptacle during the cooking rise above fifty pounds, the safety-valve blows off and part of the vaporous content escapes and is so removed automatically. This solid matter, or tankage, as it is now called, is then removed and compressed into what is technically known as cheese. The expressed liquid resulting from this compression is recovered, allowed to stand in a suitable receptacle, and the oleaginous matter skimmed off the top and preserved. The remaining liquid is added to raw garbage and serves the purpose in a new cooking which has been heretofore described. The compressed cheese is dried in a suitable drying apparatus. A fine mealy homogeneous product results, which represents substantially the total initial weight of the garbage less its combined water and the oleaginous content, and which has a greater weight and value than those products resulting from processes in which liquid is permitted to drain off after the cooking operation and in which much valuable material is thus lost.  \n  We have found that by the use of our abovedescribed process nearly all of the valuable oleagino us matter is recovered, only a very small percentage of it remaining in the tankage.  \n  By the term garbage we mean to include not only kitchen refuse, both animal and vegetable, but also slaughter-house and packing-house oi\u0026#39;t\u0026#39;al, and refuse and offal of analogous character.  \n  Other modes of applying the principle of our invention may be employed instead of the one explained, change being made as regards the means herein disclosed, provided the means stated by any one of the following claims or the equivalent of such stated means be employed.  \n  We therefore particularly point out and distinctly claim as our invention- 1. The improved subprocess for treating garbage which consists in expressing liquid from tankage, cooking such expressed liquid and raw garbage in a closed air tight receptacle by radiated heat, and then separating from such receptacle vaporous and free-water content by exhausting both the normal vapors and also those that result from the Water which is volatilizing.  \n  2. The improved subprocess for treating garbage which consists in expressing liquid from tankage, cooking such expressed liquid and raw garbage in a closed air-tight receptacle by radiated heat, maintaining the heat and then separating from such receptacle all of its vaporous and free-water content by exhausting both the normal vapors and also continuously exhausting those vapors that result from the water which is volatilizing by reason of the high temperature maintained in the receptacle by the radiating heat.  \n  3. The improved subprocess for treating garbage which consists in expressing liquid from tankage, cooking such expressed liquid and raw garbage in a closed air-tight receptacle by heat radiating from and toward the center of said receptacle maintaining the heat and then separating from such receptacle all of its vaporous and free-water content by exhausting both the normal vapors and also continuously exhausting those vapors that result from the water which is volatilizing by reason of the high temperature maintained in the receptacle by the radiating heat.  \n  4..

The fan-case C has opeuingswin itil c ir cumferonce, in which are secured elastic or flexible pipes or tubes E, one or more, as maybe desired. We have shown two iuA this example. Theirv nozzles are hung in a sliding frame, F, which is arranged to slide up and down in the extension A\u0026#39; of the frame of the machine, the object b eing to adjust or move the nozzles of the pipes to a higher or lower elevation, according to the height\u0026#39;of the cottonin the field. The sliding frame-F is raised by means of u. winch, I, and rop, G, the latter n going over a pulley, H, on the upper part of the extension A. The winch I is placed at a\u0026#39;poln\u0026#39;t convenient of access to the driver, forlwhom `a. seat muy be arranged en the front part of the frame A. The -nozzles of the pipes or tubes are \u0026#39;connected tothe sliding ftsmeF by means of vertical spindles\u0026#39; or rods J, fixed in the \u0026#39;cross-bars of said frame, which rods go through ears that` project from the sides of the nozzles, or from collars placed around the nozzles\u0026#39;.` VIn this example, we have formed the ears on such collars. The ears are made fast to the rods by setlscrews, by loosening which the nozzles can\u0026#39;be sot higher or loweron the rods independently of the movements ofthe sliding frame. ,The\u0026#39;vrds are so arranged in the sliding frame that they con turn on their centres, and consequently the uoazlesye perwitted to vibrate or tur in horizontal directions, so as to give u wider sweep \u0026#39;to the blasts\u0026#39;oflair that issue from them.  \n \u0026#34;lhe extension part.A of the machine has a lateral branch, seen in iig. 2, which projects fer enough to l extend beyond the row ot\u0026#39; cotton that is to be \u0026#39;operated upon, thelateral hranchbeing made high enough to go over its top. The said branch of thc extension supports, at its cuter end, a. receptacle for the cotton, to receive it as it is blown oiithe plants by the currents oi\u0026#39; air from the pipes or tubes. In this example the receptacleconsists et a bag, N, which hangs down, so as to enclose a row of cotton-plants `between it and the restot the nuschine, the upper part of the bag being distended on u wire frame, which combineslightucss with stidncss,  \n andlenables us to give :i suitable form to the uppeil portion of the bag, so that the bagA cau easily passbe\u0026#39;tween adjacent rows of plants, and be kept in proper position opposite ,the nozzles of tbeppes, thefaee of the bag opposite to them being entirely open, or having a. wide mouth, through which the cotton isblownswhen it is separated from the stalk by the force of the blasts of air. When the .bag is filled with cotton, it is replaced by a fresh bag, or else it is emptied and retained on the machine. It\u0026#39;can be emptied `from its bottoni by making its lower part `capable of being opened. The bag is made cf\u0026#39;net-\u0026#39;work or cloth, or\u0026#39;other\u0026#39;light mate-rial.  \n The running-gear and frame of tbe machine .are of such narrow dimensions\u0026#39;as will allow-tbe someto beI drawn or propelled between adjacent rows of cotton-plantspanduuy suitable inode of propulsion or draught cany be used to take it through the eld.

DIXON, OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, ASSIGNOR TO ASPHALT. PAPER \u0026#39;PIPE COMPANY, OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, A CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA.  \n AToMlzE-R.  \n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 743,697, dated November 10, 1903.  \n Application filed October 20, 1902. Sra-l No. 128,080. v(No model.)  \n zen of the United States, residing at Los Angoles, in the county of Los Angeles and State of California, have invented a new anduseful.  \n , Atomizer, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention is designed for breaking up and atomizing liquids under pressure of an expansive iiuid for spraying or distributing the liquid.  \n  A special object of the invention is to provide means whereby thick hydrocarbons may be reduced to vapor and supplied in perfectly-regulated quantities to the fire-box of a furnace, so that the fire may be constantly maintained at any determined volume and force.  \n  A further object of my invention is to provide an atomizer of simple, cheap, and durable construction, which shall be positive and eiiicient in operation and in which wear of the several parts is reduced to a minimum.  \n  A further object is to provide simple and effective means Vfor preventing any clogging, owing to the usual presence of sandor grit, in heavy thick hydrocarbon oils.  \n  To these ends my invention consists in an atomizer having a vaporizing-chamber, revoluble means therein for breaking heavy oil, an  \n inlet adapted to deliver steam or otherexpansive medium under pressure againstsaid revof luble means to operate the same, an inlet axial with respect to the revoluble means, adapted to deliver liquid at the side of said revoluble breaking means, means whereby said liquidinlet is regulated, and revoluble means whereby clogging of said liquid-inlet is prohibited.  \n  More specifically, my invention consists in an atomizer having a body comprising a vaporizing-chamber, a hollow shaft entering said cha mber axially, a revoluble breaker and mixer loosely mounted on said shaft, the face of said mixer provided with a series\u0026#39;of flights radiating from the center, a tangential expansive-medium inlet adapted to direct its stream against the periphery of said mixer, an outlet, and means whereby the duct through said shaft may be entirely or pariially closed to regulate the entrance of liquid to said chamber.  \n  The invention consists, further, in the devices, constructions, and combinations of particularly pointed out in the claims.  \n  The radiating \u0026#39;flights 17 form aser-ies `of open ways or channels, and the flights serve to cause a greater agitation and better commingling of the oil and steam.  \n  The invention will be more readily understood by reference tothe accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, and in which- Figure I is a vertical sectional view on line I I of Fig. II. Fig. II is a top plan view, partly\u0026#39;in section. Fig. III is a vertical sectional view on the line III III of Fig. IV and shows my atomizer as designed more especially for use with an expansive medium under pressure and liquid supplied thereto without pressure. Fig. IV is a top plan view, partly in section, of the atomizer shown in Fig. III.  \n  -As shown in the drawings, the breaking and mixing chamber is formed of the section \u0026#39;2, provided with a cylindrical chamber 3, and\u0026#39; a side wall\u0026#39;or cover-section 4, adapted .to be secured together in the ordinary or anysuitable manner. Through the center of the wall 2.1 provide a duct 5, which runs through the projection 6, extending inwardly from the wall 2 andforming a hollow shaft 0r hub for the rotary breaker andinixer 7,loosely mount- Y ed thereon,the shaft extendingnearly through \u0026#39;the breaker and the duct therein communi- :eating into the `chamber through the port 8. An inlet through the wall 2 registers with the duct of the shaft 6. The end of the shaft 6 is beveled, as shown, and the wall of the bearing in the breaker 7 is provided with an inclined wall 9, near to which this beveled end operates. It will be noted that a slight clearance is thus provided, for theY purpose hereinafter mentioned, between the end of the shaft-.and the opening or port 8.. The periphery of the breaker\u0026#39; and mixer 7 is provided with a series of teeth, as shown, and the side opposite the shaft or huby 6 is provided with a series of iights 17, radiating from the port 8.  \n The wall is provided with an inlet l0 for steam or other expansive material. This in-K,  \n parts, all as hereinafter described, and more IOO let enters the chamber at a tangent and is adapted to direct the jet of steam against the toothed periphery of the breaker and`mixer 7. Opposite the inlet 10 is a tangential outlet 18, which, as shown, isof greater area than the area of the inlet-ports 8 and 10.  \n  The cover-section 4 is provided with a threaded bearing 11, into which the liquidinlet regulator l2 is adapted to be screwed. This regulator is in turn connected with an arm 13 by a nut 14. A set-screw 15 passes through this arm and is adapted to hold the regulator in the desired position. A packinggland 16 is provided, as shown, about the regulator 12.  \n  The operation is as follows: A-jet of steam under pressure is introduced through the\u0026#39;inlet 10 and strikes against the toothed periphery thereof, causing the breaker and mixer to rotate rapidly. A stream of oil passing through the inlet and hollow shaft or hub G is discharged against the wall 2 of the chamber, and the flights 17 accentuate the breaking of the oil and its thorough mixing with the steam therein. The resultant vapor passes out from the chamber through the outlet 18. All sand, sediment, or heavy material whichmight cause the clogging of the port Sis ground up between the end\u0026#39;of the hub 6 and the inclined wall or seat and the Wallsurrounding the port 8. By releasing the set-screw 15 and throwing the arm 13 the regulator 12 is turned toward or awayfrom the port 8, regulating the discharge of oil therefrom. By this means 1 provide .a device which thoroughly breaks up heavy thick oil and intermingles it with steam, forming a quick and readily burning vapor. I provide a removable and renewable seat yfor the rotary breaker. This consists of\u0026#39; the washer 19, preferably of brass, inserted on the hub 6 between the wall and the side of breaker shown.  \n  In Figs. III and IV, I have shown a modification of the atomizer of Figs. I and II. As shown in Figs. III and IV, the flights 17 are covered by a plate or disk 20, which is secured on the flights by screws 21 or by any other suitable means. This plate or disk, if desired, may be formed integral with the flights 17, the same being cored ont in castings, and where- I hereinafter refer to such plate 20 I include either constructing the same as a plate fixed on said flights or as integral with the breaker. It is thus seen that in this form channels or ducts are formed between the side of the rotary breaker and the plate or disk 2O by the flights 17. As shown, thc inclined wall 9of the bearing in the breaker and the inclined portion of the hollow hub or shaft are omitted and the hub or shaft adapted to extend out flush with the side or face of the breaker, the plate 20 being construction shown in Figs. III and IV, I am enabled to use my atomizer in connection with a liquid-supply without providing pressure for forcing the liquid into the atomizer. The expansive-medium stream under pressure striking the teeth on the periphery of the breaker, rotating the same, causes centrifugal action, by which the induction of the oil to the breaking-chamber is accomplished.  \n  It is obvious that many equivalents for constructions and parts shown will readily suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, and I therefore do not con fine myself to the exact construction shown or described, but may use many mechanical equivalents therefor.  \n  Having described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Paten ofthe United States, is-  \n  1.

Sra-l No. 128,080. v(No model.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ezen of the United States, residing at Los Angoles, in the county of Los Angeles and State of California, have invented a new anduseful. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, Atomizer, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention is designed for breaking up and atomizing liquids under pressure of an expansive iiuid for spraying or distributing the liquid. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A special object of the invention is to provide means whereby thick hydrocarbons may be reduced to vapor and supplied in perfectly-regulated quantities to the fire-box of a furnace, so that the fire may be constantly maintained at any determined volume and force. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A further object of my invention is to provide an atomizer of simple, cheap, and durable construction, which shall be positive and eiiicient in operation and in which wear of the several parts is reduced to a minimum. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A further object is to provide simple and effective means Vfor preventing any clogging, owing to the usual presence of sandor grit, in heavy thick hydrocarbon oils. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To these ends my invention consists in an atomizer having a vaporizing-chamber, revoluble means therein for breaking heavy oil, an \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einlet adapted to deliver steam or otherexpansive medium under pressure againstsaid revof luble means to operate the same, an inlet axial with respect to the revoluble means, adapted to deliver liquid at the side of said revoluble breaking means, means whereby said liquidinlet is regulated, and revoluble means whereby clogging of said liquid-inlet is prohibited. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e More specifically, my invention consists in an atomizer having a body comprising a vaporizing-chamber, a hollow shaft entering said cha mber axially, a revoluble breaker and mixer loosely mounted on said shaft, the face of said mixer provided with a series'of flights radiating from the center, a tangential expansive-medium inlet adapted to direct its stream against the periphery of said mixer, an outlet, and means whereby the duct through said shaft may be entirely or pariially closed to regulate the entrance of liquid to said chamber. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The invention consists, further, in the devices, constructions, and combinations of particularly pointed out in the claims. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The radiating 'flights 17 form aser-ies `of open ways or channels, and the flights serve to cause a greater agitation and better commingling of the oil and steam. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The invention will be more readily understood by reference tothe accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, and in which- Figure I is a vertical sectional view on line I I of Fig. II. Fig. II is a top plan view, partly'in section. Fig. III is a vertical sectional view on the line III III of Fig. IV and shows my atomizer as designed more especially for use with an expansive medium under pressure and liquid supplied thereto without pressure. Fig. IV is a top plan view, partly in section, of the atomizer shown in Fig. III. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e -As shown in the drawings, the breaking and mixing chamber is formed of the section '2, provided with a cylindrical chamber 3, and' a side wall'or cover-section 4, adapted .to be secured together in the ordinary or anysuitable manner. Through the center of the wall 2.1 provide a duct 5, which runs through the projection 6, extending inwardly from the wall 2 andforming a hollow shaft 0r hub for the rotary breaker andinixer 7,loosely mount- Y ed thereon,the shaft extendingnearly through 'the breaker and the duct therein communi- :eating into the `chamber through the port 8. An inlet through the wall 2 registers with the duct of the shaft 6. The end of the shaft 6 is beveled, as shown, and the wall of the bearing in the breaker 7 is provided with an inclined wall 9, near to which this beveled end operates. It will be noted that a slight clearance is thus provided, for theY purpose hereinafter mentioned, between the end of the shaft-.and the opening or port 8.. The periphery of the breaker' and mixer 7 is provided with a series of teeth, as shown, and the side opposite the shaft or huby 6 is provided with a series of iights 17, radiating from the port 8. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall is provided with an inlet l0 for steam or other expansive material. This in-K, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparts, all as hereinafter described, and more IOO let enters the chamber at a tangent and is adapted to direct the jet of steam against the toothed periphery of the breaker and`mixer 7. Opposite the inlet 10 is a tangential outlet 18, which, as shown, isof greater area than the area of the inlet-ports 8 and 10. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The cover-section 4 is provided with a threaded bearing 11, into which the liquidinlet regulator l2 is adapted to be screwed. This regulator is in turn connected with an arm 13 by a nut 14. A set-screw 15 passes through this arm and is adapted to hold the regulator in the desired position. A packinggland 16 is provided, as shown, about the regulator 12. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The operation is as follows: A-jet of steam under pressure is introduced through the'inlet 10 and strikes against the toothed periphery thereof, causing the breaker and mixer to rotate rapidly. A stream of oil passing through the inlet and hollow shaft or hub G is discharged against the wall 2 of the chamber, and the flights 17 accentuate the breaking of the oil and its thorough mixing with the steam therein. The resultant vapor passes out from the chamber through the outlet 18. All sand, sediment, or heavy material whichmight cause the clogging of the port Sis ground up between the end'of the hub 6 and the inclined wall or seat and the Wallsurrounding the port 8. By releasing the set-screw 15 and throwing the arm 13 the regulator 12 is turned toward or awayfrom the port 8, regulating the discharge of oil therefrom. By this means 1 provide .a device which thoroughly breaks up heavy thick oil and intermingles it with steam, forming a quick and readily burning vapor. I provide a removable and renewable seat yfor the rotary breaker. This consists of' the washer 19, preferably of brass, inserted on the hub 6 between the wall and the side of breaker shown. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In Figs. III and IV, I have shown a modification of the atomizer of Figs. I and II. As shown in Figs. III and IV, the flights 17 are covered by a plate or disk 20, which is secured on the flights by screws 21 or by any other suitable means. This plate or disk, if desired, may be formed integral with the flights 17, the same being cored ont in castings, and where- I hereinafter refer to such plate 20 I include either constructing the same as a plate fixed on said flights or as integral with the breaker. It is thus seen that in this form channels or ducts are formed between the side of the rotary breaker and the plate or disk 2O by the flights 17. As shown, thc inclined wall 9of the bearing in the breaker and the inclined portion of the hollow hub or shaft are omitted and the hub or shaft adapted to extend out flush with the side or face of the breaker, the plate 20 being construction shown in Figs. III and IV, I am enabled to use my atomizer in connection with a liquid-supply without providing pressure for forcing the liquid into the atomizer. The expansive-medium stream under pressure striking the teeth on the periphery of the breaker, rotating the same, causes centrifugal action, by which the induction of the oil to the breaking-chamber is accomplished. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is obvious that many equivalents for constructions and parts shown will readily suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, and I therefore do not con fine myself to the exact construction shown or described, but may use many mechanical equivalents therefor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Paten ofthe United States, is- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

Ross and LAWRENCE SINGER, citizens of the United States of America, residing at Allegheny, in the county of Allegheny and State of Penn` Sylvania, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Apparatus for Increas-l ing Speed of Vessels, of which the following is a specification, referenceV beinghad therein to the accompanying drawings.  \n  This invention relates to certain new and useful improvements in apparatuses for in\u0026#39;- creasing the speed of vessels and the like, the primary object of which is to provide means carried by a vessel whereby the speed of the same maybe increased, at the same time pro-` viding means whereby during a storm or rough sea the speed of the vessel may be increased by the quieting of the sea.  \n  Another object of our invention is to provide novel means which may be attached to the vessels of any description, whereby the speed of the vessel may be increased when it is desired,K means being provided for controlling the first said `means, and a still further object of our invention is to provide an apparatus which will be extremely simple in construction, strong, and durable, and one which will occupy comparatively small\u0026#39;space within a vessel and be readily applied to the different constructions used in building\u0026#39;vessels.  \n  Another importantfeature of our invention is the provision of novel means whereby bar-Y nacles and like foul growth willbe prevented from clinging to the sides of the vessels, whereby the speed of the same will be greatly increased and the liferof thc samezconsider# ably lengthened. f L i The invention finally consists in the novel construction, combination, and arrangement of parts to be hereinafter more fully described, and specifically pointed out in the claim. v  \n  In describing the invention in detail ref-v erence is had to the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this specification, and` wherein like numerals lof reference indicate like parts throughout the several views, in which f Figure l is a sectional View of the end of a boat, showing our improved apparatus at- Serial No; 162,944. (No model.)  \n tached thereto. Fig. 2 is a fragmentary sectional view ofthe bow of a boat; and\u0026#39;Fig. 3 is a detail side elevation of our improved apparatus, showing the bow of the boat in dotted lines. In carrying out our invention we provide a tank and distributing means which may be .readilyattached to any boat, and in Fig. vl  \n i the apparatus as near the bow of the boat as possible, whereby the entire boat will be aided and influenced by the apparatus.  \n . The reference-numeralQ indicates the base ofthe tank, which has a\u0026#39; suitable outlet 3, which connects with the vertical pipe 4, having a plurality of outlets 5, said outlets consisting of pipes 6, which passes through the hull of the vessel 7 and through the shell or sides of the vessel, the end of said pipes being beveled, as indicated in Fig. 2 of the drawings, the side of the pipes nearest the bow projecting farther out, as indicated at 8, these pipes being cut at such an angle that the .opposite side of the` pipe is flush with the l side of the vessel, as indicatedat 9, whereby a slight obstruction will be presented and a suction formed which will carry any liquid coming through the pipes along the sides of the vessel and prevent the same from spreading out and leaving the vesselV were not this suction provided.  \n  Located upon the vertical pipe 4and preferably between the tank and the outlet, we provide a valve 10, which may be controlled at the tank or suitable mechanism provided whereby the same may be controlled from theV engine-room or any desired position, and in Fig. 3 of the drawings we `have illustrated a lever 11, which may pass rearwardly tothe desired operating-point.  \n  The reference-numeral l2 indicates the closed end of the vertical pipe 4, and while we have described this pipe as being vertical it is obvious that we may employ a pipe at an angle where the construction of the ves- ICO sel necessitates the same, and any number of outlets may be employed, the same depending upon the height and the draft of the vessel.  \n  In Fig. 2 of the drawings it will be noted that we have illustrated the water-line in dotted lines, whereby the outlets will be beneath the water and the liquid which passes from the pipes will be thoroughly mixed with the water.  \n  We desire to employ anylubricating oil or liquid within the tank 1, whereby the same will have a steady flow through the pipes 5 and into the water when the valve l0 is opened, said lubrioator or oil being of such a nature as to quiet the water, whereby the speed of the vessel will be increased. It will be seen by the construction of the ends ofthe pipe 5 that the lubricating oil or liquid will be driven rearwardly against the sides of the vessel and thus prevent the barnacles from becoming attached to the sides of the Vessel, whereby the retarding of the Speed of the vessel will be prevented.  \n  It will be noted that We have illustrated our improved apparatus as applied to a yacht and a heavier vessel, and it is obvious that the same may be used to advantage upon ocean liners and battle-ships, and it will be noted that other various changes may be made in the details of construction without departing from the general spirit ot\u0026#39; our invention.  \n  Having fully described our invention, what we claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-  \n  In an oil-distrib\u0026#39;uter comprisinga tank and a downwardly-extending main pipe leading therefrom, a plurality ot\u0026#39; branch pipes horizontally extending from said main pipe, and projecting through the sides of the vessel, the extended portions of said pipes being angularly cut at their lower ends, said lower ends being `flush with the sides of the vessel.  \n  In testimony whereof We affix our signatures in the presence of two witnesses.  \n  JOHN K.

Application filed March 31, 1903. Serial No. 150,845. (No model.)  \n To a whom it may concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, Mosns S. PITTMAN,-a citizen of the United States, residing at Independence, in the county of Jackson and State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Railway-Switches, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention relates to railway-switches of that type whereby the derailment of the train by the inopportune opening or closing of the switch is impossible, and has for its object to produce a switch of this character whereby the train\u0026#39;shall be deflected from the siding onto the main track without regard to the position of the switch or to the direction in which the train is moving.  \n  A further object is to produce means for locking the switch in an opened or closed po sition to guard against accidentally deflecting the train from the main onto the side track and for relieving the switch-stand of such duty.  \n  A still further object is to provide ineans whereby the operation of the switch-stand shall unlock the auxiliary locking mechanism and then effect the desired movement of the switch and cause the auxiliary mechanism to relock the switch in its new position.  \n  A still further object is to produce a switch possessing the features of advantage ennmerated above, whereby the transfer of the car from the main onto the side track, or vice versa, shall be effected with no perceptible abrupt swerve or lateral movement of the train and Withoutimposing a dangerous lateral pressure on any of the track or guard rails;  \n  To these ends the invention consists in certain novel and peculiar features of construction and organizatiomas hereinafter described and claimed, and in order that it may be fully understood reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings, in which- I Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of the main track, the side track, both broken away, and of the preferred and modified forms of the switch mechanism at opposite ends of the side track. Fig. 2 is a plan view,on a larger scale, of that portion of the track and the contiguous end of the siding equipped with my preferred type of switch and with the auxiliary\u0026#39;locking mechanism therefor. Fig. 3 is a similar view of the main track and contiguous end of the side track at the opposite end of the siding and also shows its auxiliary locking mechanism. Fig. 4 is a vertical section on the line IV IV of Fig. 3. Fig. 5 is an enlarged cross-section taken on the lineV V of Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is an enlarged sectional perspective view showing the contiguous ends of one of the switch-rails\u0026#39;of the modified form and the al\u0026#39;ined guard-rail.  \n  In the said drawings, 1 designates the straight unbroken rail of the main track, and 2, 3, and 4 the broken main-track rail. 5  \n designates the outer side-track rail, the same from the point a to b and cto cl also forming portions of the broken main-track rail, said portions diverging almost imperceptibly with respect to main-track rail 1 toward the siding, this divergence being so slight that when the wheels are at the point a or 0 their flanges are inward of the points of main-track rail portion 3, while their treadportions overlie said points and rest upon the track portions a b c d at points a and c.  \n  6 designates the inner side-track rail, the same crossing main-traek-rail portion 3 in the customary manner and at the right-hand end projecting beyond the corresponding end of said portion 3 and terminating in a point 7, the bevel of said point being at the opposite side from rail 1, as shown clearly in Fig. 2. The opposite end of rail 6 terminates at the point 8 short of the corresponding termination of rail 3, and the point 8 is beveled slightly at both sides, as at 9 and 10, the extreme end of the railbeing beveled sharply, as at 11, for a purpose which hereinafter appears.  \n 12 and 13 designate the guard-rails, ar-  \n ranged inward of the main track at its rightrail 15 at such end to provide a comparatively wide space wherein the flanges of the carwheels may pass when leaving rail 3 in travcling to the right or through which the wheels may pass when traveling in the opposite direction for the purpose of disposing their flanges inward of said rail 3, the end of said rail 3 pointing into such space being preferably beveled, as shown at 16. By the arrangement described it will be apparent that a train moving to the left on the main track will be imperceptibly moved or crowded to the right because of the engagement of its right-hand wheel-flanges with the converging rail 14, the result being said wheels are positively and reliably crowded to the right or outer side of point 7 of rail 6, while the wheels at the left-hand side--viz., at this time on the track portion a b-are caused to follow the dotted line 6 and dispose their flanges at the inner side of rail 3, and it\u0026#39;will also be apparent that should the train move in the opposite direction it will continue on the main track without regard to whether the switch has been operated in the meantime or not. Should the switch be thrown to the left, as shown by dotted lines, Fig. 2, before the train reaches it when traveling in the direction indicated by the arrow Fig. 1 it will be caused by rail 15 to hug rail portion a 1) until its foremost wheels at the right-hand side have been disposed at the inner side of the beveled end 7 of the rail 6 of the side track, said beveled rail 7 compelling the flanges of the wheels at the opposite side of the track to enter the space between point 16 of rail 3 and trackrail 5 at the point a. Should said train be backed while on the side track, it will obviously return onto the main track, and this is true even though the switch has in the meantime been returned to its original position, as shown by full lines, Fig. 2.  \n  The movable switch-rails 14; 15 are tied together in the usual manner by cross-bars 17, and for the purpose of guarding against accidentally throwing the train onto the side track and also for relieving the switch-stand of the strain of holding the switch in either position I provide the following construction:  \n  18 is a cross-rod for connection with the switch-stand at one end and underlying the rails and provided with longitudinal slots 19, slidingly engaged by bolts 20, secured to angle-plates 21, bolted rigidly to the inner sides of the switch-rails.  \n  22 23 are links pivoted at their opposite ends to the cross-rod 18 and to the bentarms 24 of clamp-plates 25, pivoted to operate horizontally on bed-plates 26,secured to the crosstie and underlying the switch\u0026#39;rails to relieve the tie of wear incident to the movement of the switch. \\Vhen the switch is closed, the clamp-plate contiguous to rail 14 is so disposed that it clamps said rail against the pointed end 7 of rail 6, the pressure on rail 14. being applied at about right angles to it, so that its tendency to move in the opposite direction only the more reliably holds itin the position stated. At the same time the clamp-plate at the opposite side is thrown to inoperative position, as shown in Fig. 2, to permit the companion sWitch-rail15 to be moved with and in the same direction as rail 14-. \\Vhen the switch is opened by the proper manipulation of the switchstand, rod 18 moves in the direction indicated by the contiguous arrow, Fig. 2, and synchronously through the medium of said links actsfirst to throw the formerly operative clamp-plate 25 to inoperative position and the formerly inoperative clamp-plate 25 toward operative position. During this operation the switchrails remain stationary, because the slots 19 travel on bolts 20. By the time the firstnamed plate 25 has assumed a position permitting rail 14 to move the opposite ends of slots 19 engage the bolts 20, so that further movement of rod 18 shall effect the opening of the switch, and by the time this opening movement is completed the clamp-plates have assumed positions approximately at right anglcs to their original positions, with the firstmentioned one inoperative and the other bearing against and holding rail 15 in the position shown in dotted lines, Fig. 2, so as to prevent the accidental closing of the switch. It will thus be seen that the operation of rod 18 by means of the switch-stand resultsin first unlocking. the auxiliary lock and then opening or closing and locking the switchin its opened or closed position, the result being that the auxiliary lock relieves the switch-stand of the strain incident to holding the switch in either of its positions.  \n  Referring now to Figs. 3, at, and 6 particularly, 27 designates a short guardrail contiguous to rail 5 and beyond the contiguous point of the main-track section 3, and 28 a guard-rail secured inward of and contiguous to rail 1, and secured to said rails in the usual or any preferred manner for lateral movement are the switch-rails 29 30, the switchrail 29 extending divergiugly from rail 5 toward rail 3 and contiguous to the point of the latter, having its end bent inward and lapping such point, as shown at 31, while rail 30 is beveled to aline with and lap the inner side of rail 6 at its beveled end 11, and said rail 30 by proximity to rail 1 insures that the flanges of ti\u0026#39;ainwheels on rail 5 when traveling in the direction indicated by the arrow Fig. 3 shall pass onto rail 3 at the inner side of its point. From said point the outer side of rail 30 when in its closed posi tion about parallels the beveled side 10 of rail 6, so that should the switch be left open accidentally when a train is traveling from the side track in the opposite direction from that indicated by the arrow Fig. 3 its righthand wheel-flanges will pass between the beveled ends of said rails to the outer side of rail 30 with no swerve or lateral movement perceptible to the passengers, and should said train return while the switch was in the same position it would be caused by switch-rail 29 crowding the opposite wheels against rails 5 to run onto the side track. Ordinarily the train will be transferred from the side to the main track when the switch is closed, the flanges of the right-hand wheels in this case traveling along at the inner side of switchrail 30 and being crowded against the latter by rail 5, so as to compel such flanges to pass through the opening 32, formed between the contiguous ends of rails 28 and 30 by beveling the outer side of the former inwardly, as at 33, and the inner side of rail 30 outwardly,  \n as at 34, the said bevel of said surfaces being so gradual as to transfer the train from the side to the main track witho ut shock orjarperceptible to the passengers. A train approaching the switch in the direction indicated by the arrow Fig. 3 with the switch closed, as shown, will be crowded by the guard-rail 28 against rail 1, so as ,to reliably conduct the train on such rail past said opening 31, and the course of the train will be the same if the switch was opened, in the latter event, as hereinbefore explained, passing onto the side track at the end of the switch. The switch-rails are connected rigidly together by cross-bars 17, as explained with reference to the switch first described,and the switch is also provided with an auxiliary locking mechanism to be operated from the switch-stand in precisely the same way that the. first-named auxiliary locking mechanism is operated. The construction of the auxiliary locking mechanism of switchrails 29 and 30 is precisely the same as that already described except that it isshown with the clamp-plates 25 mounted at opposite sides of bar 18 instead of at the same side, the re sult being the links 22 23 do not cross or intersect each other. To make the drawings as simple and few as possible, the two\u0026#39;different styles of switch are shown at opposite sides of the siding; but it will be understood that in practice one form or the other will preferably be employed.  \n  From the above description it will be apparent that I have produced a railway-switch embodying the features of advantage enumerated as desirable in the statement of invention and which is susceptible of modification in various particulars without departing from the essential spirit and scope or sacrificing any of its advantages.  \n  Having thus described the invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is- I 1. A railway-switch, comprising an unbroken and a broken main-track rail, a broken and an unbroken side-track rail, the latter also forming a part of the broken and divergin g from the unbroken main-track rail toward the siding, guard rails between the maintrack rails, and a switch guard-rail in line with the guardrails and between the latter and the intermediate portions of the broken main and side track rails and lapping the inner side of the latter.  \n  2. A railway switch, comprising an unbroken and a broken main-track rail, a broken and an unbroken side-track rail, the latter forming also part of the broken main-track rail, and diverging from the unbroken maintrack rail toward the siding, the broken sidetrack rail having its intermediate portion projecting beyond the end of the corresponding portion of the broken main-track rail, guardrails between the main-track rails, and switch and guard rails in line with the guard-rails and between the latter and the ends of the intermediate portions of the broken main and side .track rails, and lappingv the inner side of the latter.  \n  3.

PITTMAN,-a citizen of the United States, residing at Independence, in the county of Jackson and State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Railway-Switches, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates to railway-switches of that type whereby the derailment of the train by the inopportune opening or closing of the switch is impossible, and has for its object to produce a switch of this character whereby the train'shall be deflected from the siding onto the main track without regard to the position of the switch or to the direction in which the train is moving. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A further object is to produce means for locking the switch in an opened or closed po sition to guard against accidentally deflecting the train from the main onto the side track and for relieving the switch-stand of such duty. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A still further object is to provide ineans whereby the operation of the switch-stand shall unlock the auxiliary locking mechanism and then effect the desired movement of the switch and cause the auxiliary mechanism to relock the switch in its new position. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A still further object is to produce a switch possessing the features of advantage ennmerated above, whereby the transfer of the car from the main onto the side track, or vice versa, shall be effected with no perceptible abrupt swerve or lateral movement of the train and Withoutimposing a dangerous lateral pressure on any of the track or guard rails; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To these ends the invention consists in certain novel and peculiar features of construction and organizatiomas hereinafter described and claimed, and in order that it may be fully understood reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings, in which- I Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of the main track, the side track, both broken away, and of the preferred and modified forms of the switch mechanism at opposite ends of the side track. Fig. 2 is a plan view,on a larger scale, of that portion of the track and the contiguous end of the siding equipped with my preferred type of switch and with the auxiliary'locking mechanism therefor. Fig. 3 is a similar view of the main track and contiguous end of the side track at the opposite end of the siding and also shows its auxiliary locking mechanism. Fig. 4 is a vertical section on the line IV IV of Fig. 3. Fig. 5 is an enlarged cross-section taken on the lineV V of Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is an enlarged sectional perspective view showing the contiguous ends of one of the switch-rails'of the modified form and the al'ined guard-rail. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the said drawings, 1 designates the straight unbroken rail of the main track, and 2, 3, and 4 the broken main-track rail. 5 \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edesignates the outer side-track rail, the same from the point a to b and cto cl also forming portions of the broken main-track rail, said portions diverging almost imperceptibly with respect to main-track rail 1 toward the siding, this divergence being so slight that when the wheels are at the point a or 0 their flanges are inward of the points of main-track rail portion 3, while their treadportions overlie said points and rest upon the track portions a b c d at points a and c. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 6 designates the inner side-track rail, the same crossing main-traek-rail portion 3 in the customary manner and at the right-hand end projecting beyond the corresponding end of said portion 3 and terminating in a point 7, the bevel of said point being at the opposite side from rail 1, as shown clearly in Fig. 2. The opposite end of rail 6 terminates at the point 8 short of the corresponding termination of rail 3, and the point 8 is beveled slightly at both sides, as at 9 and 10, the extreme end of the railbeing beveled sharply, as at 11, for a purpose which hereinafter appears. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12 and 13 designate the guard-rails, ar- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eranged inward of the main track at its rightrail 15 at such end to provide a comparatively wide space wherein the flanges of the carwheels may pass when leaving rail 3 in travcling to the right or through which the wheels may pass when traveling in the opposite direction for the purpose of disposing their flanges inward of said rail 3, the end of said rail 3 pointing into such space being preferably beveled, as shown at 16. By the arrangement described it will be apparent that a train moving to the left on the main track will be imperceptibly moved or crowded to the right because of the engagement of its right-hand wheel-flanges with the converging rail 14, the result being said wheels are positively and reliably crowded to the right or outer side of point 7 of rail 6, while the wheels at the left-hand side--viz., at this time on the track portion a b-are caused to follow the dotted line 6 and dispose their flanges at the inner side of rail 3, and it'will also be apparent that should the train move in the opposite direction it will continue on the main track without regard to whether the switch has been operated in the meantime or not. Should the switch be thrown to the left, as shown by dotted lines, Fig. 2, before the train reaches it when traveling in the direction indicated by the arrow Fig. 1 it will be caused by rail 15 to hug rail portion a 1) until its foremost wheels at the right-hand side have been disposed at the inner side of the beveled end 7 of the rail 6 of the side track, said beveled rail 7 compelling the flanges of the wheels at the opposite side of the track to enter the space between point 16 of rail 3 and trackrail 5 at the point a. Should said train be backed while on the side track, it will obviously return onto the main track, and this is true even though the switch has in the meantime been returned to its original position, as shown by full lines, Fig. 2. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The movable switch-rails 14; 15 are tied together in the usual manner by cross-bars 17, and for the purpose of guarding against accidentally throwing the train onto the side track and also for relieving the switch-stand of the strain of holding the switch in either position I provide the following construction: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 18 is a cross-rod for connection with the switch-stand at one end and underlying the rails and provided with longitudinal slots 19, slidingly engaged by bolts 20, secured to angle-plates 21, bolted rigidly to the inner sides of the switch-rails. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 22 23 are links pivoted at their opposite ends to the cross-rod 18 and to the bentarms 24 of clamp-plates 25, pivoted to operate horizontally on bed-plates 26,secured to the crosstie and underlying the switch'rails to relieve the tie of wear incident to the movement of the switch. \\Vhen the switch is closed, the clamp-plate contiguous to rail 14 is so disposed that it clamps said rail against the pointed end 7 of rail 6, the pressure on rail 14. being applied at about right angles to it, so that its tendency to move in the opposite direction only the more reliably holds itin the position stated. At the same time the clamp-plate at the opposite side is thrown to inoperative position, as shown in Fig. 2, to permit the companion sWitch-rail15 to be moved with and in the same direction as rail 14-. \\Vhen the switch is opened by the proper manipulation of the switchstand, rod 18 moves in the direction indicated by the contiguous arrow, Fig. 2, and synchronously through the medium of said links actsfirst to throw the formerly operative clamp-plate 25 to inoperative position and the formerly inoperative clamp-plate 25 toward operative position. During this operation the switchrails remain stationary, because the slots 19 travel on bolts 20. By the time the firstnamed plate 25 has assumed a position permitting rail 14 to move the opposite ends of slots 19 engage the bolts 20, so that further movement of rod 18 shall effect the opening of the switch, and by the time this opening movement is completed the clamp-plates have assumed positions approximately at right anglcs to their original positions, with the firstmentioned one inoperative and the other bearing against and holding rail 15 in the position shown in dotted lines, Fig. 2, so as to prevent the accidental closing of the switch. It will thus be seen that the operation of rod 18 by means of the switch-stand resultsin first unlocking. the auxiliary lock and then opening or closing and locking the switchin its opened or closed position, the result being that the auxiliary lock relieves the switch-stand of the strain incident to holding the switch in either of its positions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring now to Figs. 3, at, and 6 particularly, 27 designates a short guardrail contiguous to rail 5 and beyond the contiguous point of the main-track section 3, and 28 a guard-rail secured inward of and contiguous to rail 1, and secured to said rails in the usual or any preferred manner for lateral movement are the switch-rails 29 30, the switchrail 29 extending divergiugly from rail 5 toward rail 3 and contiguous to the point of the latter, having its end bent inward and lapping such point, as shown at 31, while rail 30 is beveled to aline with and lap the inner side of rail 6 at its beveled end 11, and said rail 30 by proximity to rail 1 insures that the flanges of ti'ainwheels on rail 5 when traveling in the direction indicated by the arrow Fig. 3 shall pass onto rail 3 at the inner side of its point. From said point the outer side of rail 30 when in its closed posi tion about parallels the beveled side 10 of rail 6, so that should the switch be left open accidentally when a train is traveling from the side track in the opposite direction from that indicated by the arrow Fig. 3 its righthand wheel-flanges will pass between the beveled ends of said rails to the outer side of rail 30 with no swerve or lateral movement perceptible to the passengers, and should said train return while the switch was in the same position it would be caused by switch-rail 29 crowding the opposite wheels against rails 5 to run onto the side track. Ordinarily the train will be transferred from the side to the main track when the switch is closed, the flanges of the right-hand wheels in this case traveling along at the inner side of switchrail 30 and being crowded against the latter by rail 5, so as to compel such flanges to pass through the opening 32, formed between the contiguous ends of rails 28 and 30 by beveling the outer side of the former inwardly, as at 33, and the inner side of rail 30 outwardly, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas at 34, the said bevel of said surfaces being so gradual as to transfer the train from the side to the main track witho ut shock orjarperceptible to the passengers. A train approaching the switch in the direction indicated by the arrow Fig. 3 with the switch closed, as shown, will be crowded by the guard-rail 28 against rail 1, so as ,to reliably conduct the train on such rail past said opening 31, and the course of the train will be the same if the switch was opened, in the latter event, as hereinbefore explained, passing onto the side track at the end of the switch. The switch-rails are connected rigidly together by cross-bars 17, as explained with reference to the switch first described,and the switch is also provided with an auxiliary locking mechanism to be operated from the switch-stand in precisely the same way that the. first-named auxiliary locking mechanism is operated. The construction of the auxiliary locking mechanism of switchrails 29 and 30 is precisely the same as that already described except that it isshown with the clamp-plates 25 mounted at opposite sides of bar 18 instead of at the same side, the re sult being the links 22 23 do not cross or intersect each other. To make the drawings as simple and few as possible, the two'different styles of switch are shown at opposite sides of the siding; but it will be understood that in practice one form or the other will preferably be employed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e From the above description it will be apparent that I have produced a railway-switch embodying the features of advantage enumerated as desirable in the statement of invention and which is susceptible of modification in various particulars without departing from the essential spirit and scope or sacrificing any of its advantages. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus described the invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is- I 1.

Serial To all whom it may concern: I Be it known that I, WILLIAM H. BRADLEY, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Pittsfield, in\u0026#39;the county of Berkshire and State useful Improvement in Feeding- Gages for PrintingPresses, of which the following is a specification. v  \n  My invention relates to an improvement in feeding-gages for printing-presses of the platen type, and more particularly to that class of feeding-gages which are adjustably secured to the tympan-paper and may be adjusted with respect to the sheets to be fed.  \n  The objects of my invention are to provide afeed-gage adjust-ably attachable to tympansheet and adapted to accurately register the sheets to be fed, which gage shall be easily attached to and detached from the tympansheet, and one which can be secured thereto without the possibility of its once slipping after being secured, as well as one which will not warp or Wrinkle the tympan-sheet or in any wise injure the tympan-packing, and yet can be adjusted with respect to the size and position of the fed sheets without being removed from engagement with the tympansheet.  \n  My invention comprises, in combination with a tympan-sheet, a head or stud and a shank removably secured thereto.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of my invention secured to the tympan-sheet. Fig. 2 is a vertical section taken on line 0900 of Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a view of the parts detached.  \n  Arepresents the tympansheet,of the usual conformation and provided with Y shaped slots 1 l.  \n  B indicates the head or stud of my improved feed-gage. As shown, this stud consists of a circular body portion 2, concave on its lower face 3 and provided with a screw-threaded bore or aperturewl, located centrally of the stud. Concentric with the bore or aperture is a recessed portion 5, forming a shoulder 6,  \n the outer edge of which merges into the concave lower face 3. The body portion 2 supports a circular head 7 of larger diameter than and which head may be provided with a milled or knurled circumhave invented a new and December 1, 1903.  \n Iio.138,450. (No model.)  \n i ference 8 for a purpose hereinafter to be set forth. This head is also provided with an aperture coincident with the aperture in the bodyportion. A shank O completes the feedgage. This shankcomprisesabase 9 circular or disk-like in form, if desired, not eccentric and provided with a threaded stem 10,having a kerf in its upper end for the reception of a screw-driver or other implement, the stem being received in the threaded bore 4 of the stud.  \n  In operation the shank is inserted through the slot 1 in the tympan-sheet, the base 9 resting upon and supported by the platen, the stem projecting through the slot and above the tympansheet. The stud is then secured upon the stem, the concave lower face of the body portion, together with the annular recess, bearing against the material of which the tympan-sheet is composed, the body portion being of greater diameter than the width of the Y- shaped slot and biting thereinto, or, in other words, the tympan-sheet is securely clamped between the base of the shank portion and the lower face of the body portion, the tympan-sheet being forced into the concavity therein and into the annular recess. When it is desired to change the gage to enable it to register fed sheets of diiferent size, the stud is merely loosened on the stem the gage shifted bodily to the desired position, where it is again secured in place. The  \n object fulfilled by the Y-shaped slots is to permit a wider range of adjustment than would otherwise be possible. The fed sheets contact with the body portion of the gage and are prevented from accidental slipping over the gage or other movement by means of the head, which extends beyond the body portion. The object of the knurled edge (by which the gage is loosened and moved in the slot and the stud loosened from the shank) is to enable the operator to more easily loosen the device from and clamp it to the tympansheet.  \n  From the foregoing it will be seen that my improved gage is strong and durable, simple, and easily operated, the two portions of the gage, (the stud and the shank,) set tightly and firmly together at the outer edge, by means of the concaved portion before deand scribed, preventing the fed sheets from slipping beneath the stud, and the gage is easily and quickly adjusted.  \n  It is evident that slight changes might be made in the form and arrangement of the several parts described without departing from the spirit and scope of myinvention, and hence I do not wish to limit myself to the exact construction herein shown, but may wish from time to time to make such changes as are herein referred to in either form or arrangement, orboth, of the several parts herein described.  \n  Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, isl 1. The combination with a tympan-sheet having slots formed therein, of a feed-gage comprising a stud and a shank, the stud consisting of a body portion, the lower face of which is concaved and of a diameter greater than the width of the slotin the tympan-sheet, a head of greater diameter than the body portion carried thereby, the shank consisting of a base and a stem extending therefrom, the  \n stem removably received in the body portion of the stud, the tympan-sheet being forced into the concavity in the lower face of the body portion of the stud.  \n  2.

Y.  \n STRAIGHTWAY VALVE.  \n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 745,774, dated December 1, 1903.  \n Application filed August 2l, 1902. Serial No. 120,472. (No model.)  \n 1!) all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, EVERETT S. BRADY, a citizen of the United States, residing in the borough of Brooklyn, county of Kings, and  \n 5 city and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful .Improvements in Straightway Valves, of which the following is a specification.  \n This invention relates to valves for controlin ling,r the iiow of liuids under pressure, and particularly to the class of gate-valves or straightway valves, so called; and the bject of the invention is to provide a valvecontrolled by-pass for the iiuid at the top of .t the main gate-valve, the controlling by-pass valve seating downward or substantially perpendicular to the seating of the main valve and adapted to be operated automatically by the same means that are employed for openzo ing the main valve. The purpose of this bypass is to relieve the pressure on the main valve before it is opened by effecting a balancing ot the pressure on both sides of said valve. v In the accompanying drawings, which illustrate two embodiments of the invention,Fig ures 1 to 4 illustrate one of said embodiments. In these Fig. 1 is a section taken along the axis of the pipe through which the duid flows 3o and along the axis ofthe valve-operatingstem.  \n  Fig. 2 is a transverse section of the valvecasiug, taken at line co2 in Fig. 1, the valve being in elevation. Fig. 4 is a cross-section of the valve-chest, showing the seat of the bypass valve; and Fig. 3 is a similar section showing the by-pass valve in plan. Figs. 5, 6, and 7 illustrate the other embodiment of the invention. Fig. 5 is a section similar to Fig. 1; and Figs. 6 and 7 are sections similar, 4o respectively, to Figs. 3 and 4.  \n  In the \u0026#39;first-named embodiment the operating-stem is non-rotative and moves longitudinally when the valve is displaced, and in the last-named embodiment the stem is rotative,  \n  but does not move longitudinally, being collared.  \n  Referring, primarily, to the tirst four figures of the drawings, 1 represents a pipe or conduit through which a uid under pressure-as 5o steam, for example-flows in the direction indicated by the arrow .e in Fig. 1. In the pipe is a valve-casing 2, having in it a seat 3 and on it a box 4. A gate-valve 5, which closes to the seat 3, serves to controlfthe How of iiuid through the pipe. The pressure of the fluid holds the gate-valve pressed up to its seat with a force corresponding to the area of the said valve in square inches multiplied by the pressure per square inch ofthe steam or other fiuid. In order to operate the valve 5 and to 6o relieve the pressure of the fluid thereon at the time of opening said valve, the mechanism now to be described is employed.  \n  6 is the operating-stem of the gate-valve. This stem is screw threaded and screws 65 through a nut 7, which has in it a circumferential groove that is engaged by a sectional bearing 8, secured to the top ot\u0026#39; the box 4. The nut 7 forms the hub or boss of a handwheel 9. The lower or inner end of the stem 7o 6 has a square head 10, which tits in a recess in the back or top of a by-pass valve 11, which rests on a seat 12 in a valve-chest 13, formed in the top of the gate-valve 5, controlling two passages14 in the valve 5 and leading out 75 through the respective opposite faces thereof.  \n It may be stated here that the chest 13 is closed above by a screw-plug 15, having in it a squared aperture to receive a tubular squared stem 16 on the bypass valve. This 8o stem has a flange which is screwed to the back of the by-pass valve to form a cage or keeper for the headlO of the stem and keep the latter in its recess.  \n  To operate the valve, the hand-wheel 9 :is 85 turned, thus rotating the collared nut 7, which forms its hub. This has the effect to draw up the screw-threaded stem 6, which cannot rotate, and thereby litt the by-pass valve 11 from its seat. This permits the duid to flow 9o by or over the valve 5 by way of the passages 14 and equalize the pressure on both sides thereof; \u0026#39;but after the valve 11 has been elevated to a slight but suficient extent its back engages the cover of the chest 13 and the 95 further movement of the stem lifts or displaces the gate-valve 5 and opens a full passage for the steam or other fluid. The displaced, valve passes into the box 4, which will be made steam-tight by means of a stuflingroo box 17, through which plays the smooth or unthreaded portion of the operating-stem 6.  \n In Fig. 1 the middle portion of the box and stem are broken away for want of room. In closing the valve to cut off the dow of Huid the by-pass valve 11 closes first and then the main valve 5 closes.  \n  Obviously any form of valve 11 may be employed according to the form, size, and kind of gate-valve to which itis to be applied, and the stem 6 may be coupled non-rotatively to the valve 11 in any way desired. Preferably, however, the coupling will be loose enough to allow the valve a little freedom or play for seating evenly. The ports and passages 14 may also be of any desired shape or form. In the embodiment described the ports covered by the valve l1 open at the respective sides of the center of the valve and are of a somewhat crescent shape in cross-section. In some kinds of straightway valves this construction and arrangement is desirable as economizing available space.  \n  In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figs. 5 to 7 and which isy the form preferred where the space for placing the valve is contracted the main Valve 5a is substantially the same as in the first-described embodiment, and the by-pass valve 11a is the same also, so far as its valve functions are concerned. In this embodiment, however, the inner end of the operating-stem 6a is screw-threaded and screws through the valve 11a as a nut, and on the upper part of said stem is a collar 10a in a bearing and keeper 18 exterior to and on the box 4a. The hand-wheel 9 in this form is fixed on the outer end of the operating-stem, and the stuing-box 1\u0026#39;7a is situated between the collar and the hand-wheel. The stem 16 in this construction is or may be integral with the bypass valve. The ports 143, controlled by the by-pass Valve, are represented as disposed, respectively, in front of and back. of the center of the said valve or in a vertical plane perpendicular to that of the said ports, as shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 5, also, the valve 11\u0026#39; is shown provided with packing ou its face, and the seats about the ports 14a are shown as slightly elevated. These are not material differences, but such as may be made under certain conditions to accord with the judgment or particular views o f the constructor.  \n  In the operation of the device, as shown in Fig. 5, the collared screw-stem 6L is rotated and first lifts the by-pass valve. Then the main valve lifts. The screw-stem passes through the main valve as the latter lifts.  \n verse to the axis of the pipe through which the Huid Hows and the by-pass valve on the top of the gate-valve, with the plane of its seat substantially perpendicular to the seat of the main valve, the said by-pass valve controlling ports in the main valve and being operated by the same stem as the main valve.

Serial No. 120,472. (No model.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1!) all whom it may concern: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Be it known that I, EVERETT S. BRADY, a citizen of the United States, residing in the borough of Brooklyn, county of Kings, and \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5 city and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful .Improvements in Straightway Valves, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis invention relates to valves for controlin ling,r the iiow of liuids under pressure, and particularly to the class of gate-valves or straightway valves, so called; and the bject of the invention is to provide a valvecontrolled by-pass for the iiuid at the top of .t the main gate-valve, the controlling by-pass valve seating downward or substantially perpendicular to the seating of the main valve and adapted to be operated automatically by the same means that are employed for openzo ing the main valve. The purpose of this bypass is to relieve the pressure on the main valve before it is opened by effecting a balancing ot the pressure on both sides of said valve. v In the accompanying drawings, which illustrate two embodiments of the invention,Fig ures 1 to 4 illustrate one of said embodiments. In these Fig. 1 is a section taken along the axis of the pipe through which the duid flows 3o and along the axis ofthe valve-operatingstem. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Fig. 2 is a transverse section of the valvecasiug, taken at line co2 in Fig. 1, the valve being in elevation. Fig. 4 is a cross-section of the valve-chest, showing the seat of the bypass valve; and Fig. 3 is a similar section showing the by-pass valve in plan. Figs. 5, 6, and 7 illustrate the other embodiment of the invention. Fig. 5 is a section similar to Fig. 1; and Figs. 6 and 7 are sections similar, 4o respectively, to Figs. 3 and 4. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the 'first-named embodiment the operating-stem is non-rotative and moves longitudinally when the valve is displaced, and in the last-named embodiment the stem is rotative, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e but does not move longitudinally, being collared. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring, primarily, to the tirst four figures of the drawings, 1 represents a pipe or conduit through which a uid under pressure-as 5o steam, for example-flows in the direction indicated by the arrow .e in Fig. 1. In the pipe is a valve-casing 2, having in it a seat 3 and on it a box 4. A gate-valve 5, which closes to the seat 3, serves to controlfthe How of iiuid through the pipe. The pressure of the fluid holds the gate-valve pressed up to its seat with a force corresponding to the area of the said valve in square inches multiplied by the pressure per square inch ofthe steam or other fiuid. In order to operate the valve 5 and to 6o relieve the pressure of the fluid thereon at the time of opening said valve, the mechanism now to be described is employed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 6 is the operating-stem of the gate-valve. This stem is screw threaded and screws 65 through a nut 7, which has in it a circumferential groove that is engaged by a sectional bearing 8, secured to the top ot' the box 4. The nut 7 forms the hub or boss of a handwheel 9. The lower or inner end of the stem 7o 6 has a square head 10, which tits in a recess in the back or top of a by-pass valve 11, which rests on a seat 12 in a valve-chest 13, formed in the top of the gate-valve 5, controlling two passages14 in the valve 5 and leading out 75 through the respective opposite faces thereof. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be stated here that the chest 13 is closed above by a screw-plug 15, having in it a squared aperture to receive a tubular squared stem 16 on the bypass valve. This 8o stem has a flange which is screwed to the back of the by-pass valve to form a cage or keeper for the headlO of the stem and keep the latter in its recess. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To operate the valve, the hand-wheel 9 :is 85 turned, thus rotating the collared nut 7, which forms its hub. This has the effect to draw up the screw-threaded stem 6, which cannot rotate, and thereby litt the by-pass valve 11 from its seat. This permits the duid to flow 9o by or over the valve 5 by way of the passages 14 and equalize the pressure on both sides thereof; 'but after the valve 11 has been elevated to a slight but suficient extent its back engages the cover of the chest 13 and the 95 further movement of the stem lifts or displaces the gate-valve 5 and opens a full passage for the steam or other fluid. The displaced, valve passes into the box 4, which will be made steam-tight by means of a stuflingroo box 17, through which plays the smooth or unthreaded portion of the operating-stem 6. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Fig. 1 the middle portion of the box and stem are broken away for want of room. In closing the valve to cut off the dow of Huid the by-pass valve 11 closes first and then the main valve 5 closes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Obviously any form of valve 11 may be employed according to the form, size, and kind of gate-valve to which itis to be applied, and the stem 6 may be coupled non-rotatively to the valve 11 in any way desired. Preferably, however, the coupling will be loose enough to allow the valve a little freedom or play for seating evenly. The ports and passages 14 may also be of any desired shape or form. In the embodiment described the ports covered by the valve l1 open at the respective sides of the center of the valve and are of a somewhat crescent shape in cross-section. In some kinds of straightway valves this construction and arrangement is desirable as economizing available space. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figs. 5 to 7 and which isy the form preferred where the space for placing the valve is contracted the main Valve 5a is substantially the same as in the first-described embodiment, and the by-pass valve 11a is the same also, so far as its valve functions are concerned. In this embodiment, however, the inner end of the operating-stem 6a is screw-threaded and screws through the valve 11a as a nut, and on the upper part of said stem is a collar 10a in a bearing and keeper 18 exterior to and on the box 4a. The hand-wheel 9 in this form is fixed on the outer end of the operating-stem, and the stuing-box 1'7a is situated between the collar and the hand-wheel. The stem 16 in this construction is or may be integral with the bypass valve. The ports 143, controlled by the by-pass Valve, are represented as disposed, respectively, in front of and back. of the center of the said valve or in a vertical plane perpendicular to that of the said ports, as shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 5, also, the valve 11' is shown provided with packing ou its face, and the seats about the ports 14a are shown as slightly elevated. These are not material differences, but such as may be made under certain conditions to accord with the judgment or particular views o f the constructor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the operation of the device, as shown in Fig. 5, the collared screw-stem 6L is rotated and first lifts the by-pass valve. Then the main valve lifts. The screw-stem passes through the main valve as the latter lifts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003everse to the axis of the pipe through which the Huid Hows and the by-pass valve on the top of the gate-valve, with the plane of its seat substantially perpendicular to the seat of the main valve, the said by-pass valve controlling ports in the main valve and being operated by the same stem as the main valve. Obviously, also, the operating-stem may be disposed above, below, or at the side, and the invention may be applied to any valve to which it is adapted. The language of the description relates to the application of the invention as illustrated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus described my invention, I claim- 1.

Serial No.\u0026#39;167,350. (No model.) i  \n machines of this class individual matrices, assembled or composed in line, are presented by a supporting device known as the first elevator in front of a slotted mold, which is closed tightly against the matrices, so that the slug or linotype cast in the mold will have the type characters formed in relief on its forward edge by the matrices. The mold is secured rigidly in a vertical disk, mounted to turn on an arm projecting laterally from a horizontal slide, moved forward and backward by a cam, so that before the casting operation the mold is driven forward tightly against the matrices and after the casting operation retracted therefrom in order to draw the. characters on the contained slug out of the matrices, after which the disk is given a partial revolution in order to bring the mold in front of the ejector-blade, which serves to drive the slug or linotype out ofthe mold and between trim ming-knives into a receiv-ing ga\u0026#39;lley at the front. Heretofore it has been customary after the mold-disk has been retracted and rotated to move itforward again in order to bring the mold as near as possible to the knives between which the outgoing slug is driven. It has been found, however, that for want of suitable support-at the front the disk was liable to yield in a forward direction if, as sometimes happened, the slug adhered firmly in the mold.  \n  The aim of the present invention is to give the mold-disk a rigid support at the front during the ejection of the slug. To this end I modify the cam by which the mold-slide is actuated, so that in the second forward movement the mold is carried slightly beyond the original line, so that a surface on the molddisk adjacent to the mold is brought firmly againsta rigid support or bearing.  \n  Figure 1 is a vertical section through the mold-disk and adjacent parts of the linotypemachine, showing the mold in position to cooperate with the matrices. Fig. 2 is a horizontal section through the same on the line 2 2. Fig. 3 is a similar section showing the mold in position for the ejection of the slug and advanced beyond the position shown in the preceding figures that it may receive solid support during the ejection of the slug. Fig.  \n 4 is a vertical section on the correspondinglynumbered line of Fig. 3 looking toward the left.  \n Referring to the drawings, A represents the rigid frame of the machine, B the slotted 6 5 ally-extending arm in which the pivot or jou rnal E of the mold-disk is secured.  \n  G is the vertical cam, grooved in its side face to engage a roller 9 on the upright lever H, pivoted in the main frame and acting through a stud g thereon on the slide D for the purpose of moving the slide, thedisk, and the mold forward and backward.  \n  I is a horizontal slide mounted in the main frame and carrying at its forward end the ejector-blade J, which advancing from the rear serves to drive the slug or linotype out of the mold and between the trimming-knives K in the ordinary manner.  \n  The mold is rotated intermittingly,as usual, so as to present the mold in a horizontal position during the casting operation and there after carry it around past the stationary baseknife M until it finally assumes a vertical position in front of the ejector.  \n  The mold-disk is provided with hardened thimbles or bushings N, screwedfirmly into its face, which slide forward over fixed studs 0 on the main frame in order to hold the disk from turning and keep the mold in exact alinement with the matrices or the ejector, as the case may be.  \n Heretofore the groove in the cam G has :00  \n been of such form that the mold was moved forward after the casting operation the same distance it was advanced against the matrices before the casting operation.  \n  When the parts were in the ejecting position, there was nothing to directly support the mold against forward movement and the disk was liable to spring and allow the mold to go forward whenever the ejector acting against the slug was subjected to excessive resistance. To overcome this difficulty, I make the groove in the cam G of such form that when the mold is moved forward the second time in the ejecting position it is carried forward beyond the casting-plane and until the bushing N bears at its front end solidly against\u0026#39;the shoulder on the fixed stud O. In this manner the disk is given a very rigid support immediately adjacent to the mold and the mold supported so that it cannot spring or yield in a forward direction.  \n  While I prefer to employ the stud and the sleeve as the means of-thus supporting the disk, it is manifest that the only essential requirement is that the cam shall carry the mold forward until the disk at a point adjacent to the mold is brought to a solid bearingagainst a support on the frame.  \n  It will be manifest to the skilled mechanic that the details may be variously modified in this regard without departing from the limits of my invention or changing the mode of action.  \n  Having described my invention, what I claim is- 1. In a linotype-machine, a mold-carrying disk,a rigid disk-support, in combination with means for advancing the disk to force the mold against the line of matrices, and for subsequently advancing the disk a greater dis tance against a rigid disk-support, whereby forward movement of the mold isprevented during the ejection of the slug or linotype.  \n  2. In a linotype-machine, the slide and the mold-carrying disk mounted thereon, in combination with a cam G, acting to advance the mold to one position preparatory to the casting operation, and to a different position preparatory to the ejection of the slug, and arigid support against which the disk is seated when in the ejecting position.  \n  3. In a linotype-machine and in combination with the mold and a movable support therefor, an operating-cam constructed with portions of different radii,whereby it is adapted to advance the mold to different positions for the casting and the ejection of a slug, respectively.  \n  4. In a linotype-maehine, the mold, its supporting-disk provided with bushing, and the slide carrying said disk, a rigid support for the front of the disk, in combination with a cam acting to carry the parts forward\u0026#39;until the bushing is seated firmly against arigid support, substantially as described.  \n 5. In a linotype-machine, the main frame having a shoulderedstud O thereon, and the elevator to support the matrix-line, in combination with the mold and rotary mold-carrying disk, the horizontal slide supporting said disk, and the cam G, constructed as shown,  \n to carry the mold forward against the matrices, and to carry it forward a greater distance preparatory to the ejection of the slug. In testimony whereof I hereunto set my hand, this 7th day of July, 1903, in the presence of two attesting witnesses.  \n J. K.

Fig. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4 is a vertical section on the correspondinglynumbered line of Fig. 3 looking toward the left. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferring to the drawings, A represents the rigid frame of the machine, B the slotted 6 5 ally-extending arm in which the pivot or jou rnal E of the mold-disk is secured. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e G is the vertical cam, grooved in its side face to engage a roller 9 on the upright lever H, pivoted in the main frame and acting through a stud g thereon on the slide D for the purpose of moving the slide, thedisk, and the mold forward and backward. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e I is a horizontal slide mounted in the main frame and carrying at its forward end the ejector-blade J, which advancing from the rear serves to drive the slug or linotype out of the mold and between the trimming-knives K in the ordinary manner. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The mold is rotated intermittingly,as usual, so as to present the mold in a horizontal position during the casting operation and there after carry it around past the stationary baseknife M until it finally assumes a vertical position in front of the ejector. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The mold-disk is provided with hardened thimbles or bushings N, screwedfirmly into its face, which slide forward over fixed studs 0 on the main frame in order to hold the disk from turning and keep the mold in exact alinement with the matrices or the ejector, as the case may be. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeretofore the groove in the cam G has :00 \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen of such form that the mold was moved forward after the casting operation the same distance it was advanced against the matrices before the casting operation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e When the parts were in the ejecting position, there was nothing to directly support the mold against forward movement and the disk was liable to spring and allow the mold to go forward whenever the ejector acting against the slug was subjected to excessive resistance. To overcome this difficulty, I make the groove in the cam G of such form that when the mold is moved forward the second time in the ejecting position it is carried forward beyond the casting-plane and until the bushing N bears at its front end solidly against'the shoulder on the fixed stud O. In this manner the disk is given a very rigid support immediately adjacent to the mold and the mold supported so that it cannot spring or yield in a forward direction. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e While I prefer to employ the stud and the sleeve as the means of-thus supporting the disk, it is manifest that the only essential requirement is that the cam shall carry the mold forward until the disk at a point adjacent to the mold is brought to a solid bearingagainst a support on the frame. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be manifest to the skilled mechanic that the details may be variously modified in this regard without departing from the limits of my invention or changing the mode of action. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having described my invention, what I claim is- 1. In a linotype-machine, a mold-carrying disk,a rigid disk-support, in combination with means for advancing the disk to force the mold against the line of matrices, and for subsequently advancing the disk a greater dis tance against a rigid disk-support, whereby forward movement of the mold isprevented during the ejection of the slug or linotype. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 2. In a linotype-machine, the slide and the mold-carrying disk mounted thereon, in combination with a cam G, acting to advance the mold to one position preparatory to the casting operation, and to a different position preparatory to the ejection of the slug, and arigid support against which the disk is seated when in the ejecting position. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 3. In a linotype-machine and in combination with the mold and a movable support therefor, an operating-cam constructed with portions of different radii,whereby it is adapted to advance the mold to different positions for the casting and the ejection of a slug, respectively. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 4. In a linotype-maehine, the mold, its supporting-disk provided with bushing, and the slide carrying said disk, a rigid support for the front of the disk, in combination with a cam acting to carry the parts forward'until the bushing is seated firmly against arigid support, substantially as described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. In a linotype-machine, the main frame having a shoulderedstud O thereon, and the elevator to support the matrix-line, in combination with the mold and rotary mold-carrying disk, the horizontal slide supporting said disk, and the cam G, constructed as shown, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto carry the mold forward against the matrices, and to carry it forward a greater distance preparatory to the ejection of the slug.

(N model.)  \n To all whom it may concern;  \n  Be it known that I, LUTHER EINARSON, a citizen of the United States of America, and a resident of the city of Seattle, in the county of King and State of Washington, have invented certain-new and useful Improvements in Means to Facilitate (lasting and Drawing Fish-Nets, of which the following is a specification.  \n  My invention relates to means whereby a fish-net may be more expeditiously and conveniently cast out from a boat and more easily and quickly drawn in.  \n  Among numerous objects attained by this invention and readily understood from the following specification and accompanying drawings included as a part thereof, is the production of a simple and inexpensive device adapted to facilitate the handling of fishnets in casting and drawing and embodying essential features of utility, adaptability, and  \n general efficiency, which materially reduces the labor required to tend a fish-net, render the task of casting and drawing same less dangerous and disagreeable, and makes it possible to safely land the net in stormy weather over the pointed end of a boat.  \n  The above-mentioned and numerous other objects equally as desirable are attained by the construction, combination, and arrangement of parts. as disclosed on the drawings, set forth in this specification, and succinctly pointed out in the appended claims.  \n Withreference to the drawings filed herewith and bearing like reference characters for corresponding parts throughout, Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device indicated in position on the stern portion of a doubleended boat, and Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the bracket-stand employed to support the bearing-bar of the device and indicates the socket-plate for said bracket in relative position and shown in transverse section.  \n  Before proceeding to set up any preferred embodiment of my invention the difficulties and dangers attending the casting and drawing of large fish-nets, such as employed in the vocation known as gill-netting, will be comprehensively set forth, so that the utility of this device may be -more clearly marked and its application readily understood. has much as this form of fishing is largely carried on at night and from small boats, the hanwhen fishing from a double-ended boat, as  \n the net employed is heavy and unwieldy to handle and it requires extreme care and prolonged time to guide it free of the gunwale at the point of the stern when the net is cast and drawn and on which it is oftentimes torn. In stormy weather it is almost impossible to land the netin the boat and lay it with the corks and leads clear, so that when again cast the net will play outproperly, and it has heretofore been oftentimes necessary to cut the net adrift from the boat to save the lives of the fishermen, owing to the length of time red uired to draw in the net. With these difiiculties in View my aim has been to provide a simple and compactly-arranged device I which shall act to support the net clear of the gunwale during its passage to and from the boat and which may be readily adjusted to act as either an inboard or outboard hearing to thus carry the net and shall be removable, so that it may be stored away when not in use.  \n  In the present embodiment the device includes a cylindrical bearing-bar, as 10, of considerable length and comparatively small diameter and which is preferably of Wood as best suited to avoid injuring the net and as\u0026#39;now considered is formed with a guardflange, as at 11, at each end of greater diameter than the bar and likewise composed of wood and rendered with the inner side surface conical, so as to better serve to prevent portions of the net from leaving the bar as passed thereover, and thereby insure delivery thereof free of the gunwale of the boat.  \n  As now considered, the bearing-bar 10 is rotatably supported by a bracket-stand 12, suitably adapted to be removably seated on a boat or the like, as 14, and including a shank 15, carrying upwardly-extending arms 24 at one end and preferably rendered rectangular in cross-section and formed with a downwardly-projecting stem 16 at the opposite end, disposed substantially at right augles and likewise rectangular in cross-section and preferably cousistingof an end portion of the shank bent at the desired angle thereto.  \n vThis stem is adapted to removably fit in a suitable socket 17, of like form in cross-section, arranged at the desired point on the boat for proper application of the bearingbar, as will be presently understood. This socket is conveniently formed in a metallic socket-plate, as 18, adapted to insure rigid support of the bearing-bar and consisting of a rectangular section of plate metal having the socket located centrally therein and preferably extended downwardly by conveniently forming a flange 19 on the under surface of the plate, and as now considered this socketplate is seated on the stern of the boat and iiecured in place by suitable bolts 21 or the ike.  \n  In the present construction of the bracketstand the arms 24 comprise suitable oppositely-disposed furcations of the shank extendingsubstantiallyatrightangles theretoin the same plane and having their end portions bent upwardly to form stems 23, having suitablejournals22 attheuppcrendsfortheaxisof the bearing-bar and formedof suitable length to support the said bar the required distance above the shank to freely pass the not over the gunwale. These stems are preferably given a slight inclination outwardly, so as to cause the bearing-bar to rest outboard when the bracket-stand is disposed as in Fig. 1 or when turned to the port or starboard, and to cause the bearing-bar to stand inboard when the position of said bracket is reversed and which can be readily moved to either of said positions by reason of the square stem and socket, which form of the same also insures arigid unyielding position of the device.  \n  As now considered, the journals for the axis of the bearing-bar consist of suitable apertures or eyes 25, conveniently formed in the upper end of the stems 23, and said axis consists of suitable lug screws 26, passed through said eyes and screwed into respective ends of the bearing-bar.  \n  In use the device is ordinarily positioned as indicated in Fig. 1. The bearing-bar 10 acts as an outboard-bearing to support the net clear of the gunwale at the point of the stern, and in casting same it simply requires that a few fathoms be first passed out, when the balance of the not will be thereby drawn from the boat into the Water without assistance from the fisherman, who simply applies the oars to propel the boat, and when the net is being drawn in it may be readily laid in proper condition in the boat with the leads and corks clear, as no effort or attention is required to keep it clear of the gunwale.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patentof the United States of America, is-  \n  1. The combination with a boat; of a bracket-stand including a shank and upwardly-extending arms inclined outwardly from the perpendicular, means to removably seat said stand on the boat with said arms lying either inboard or outboard, and a bearing-bar supported on said arms.\u0026#34;  \n  2. The combination with a boat; of a bracket-stand comprising a shank, upwardlyextending arms inclined outwardly from the perpendicular and a downwardly-extending stem, a socket-plate arranged on the boat to removably receive the stem of said bracket with said arms lying either inboard or outboard, and a bearing-bar rotatably supported on said arms.  \n  3. The combination with a boat; of a bracket-stand comprising a horizontally-disposed shank, upwardly-extending arms at one end of said shank inclined outwardly from the. perpendicular and a downwardlyprojecting square stem at the opposite end, a socket-plate on said boat adjacent the gunwale and having a square socket, and a bearing-bar supported on said arms.  \n  4:. The combination with a boat; of a rotatable, net-supporting bearing-bar having a guard-flange at each end, and a bracket-stand comprising a horizontally-disposed shank, oppositely disposed, upwardly projecting, bar-supporting arms at one end of the shank inclined outwardly from the perpendicular and a downwardly-projecting stem at the opposite end, and means carried by said boat to removably seat said shank with the bar lying clear of the gunwale either inboard or outboard.  \n  5. The combination with a boat; of a rotatable net supporting bearing bar having a guard-flange at each end formed with the inner side face conical, a bracket-stand comprising a horizontally-disposed shank having oppositely disposed upwardly projecting arms at one end inclined outwardly from the perpendicular and each having a journal for the axis of said bar, a downwardly-projecting square stem. at the opposite end, and a socket-plate on said boat having a square socket adapted to removably receive said stem with the shank-extending to either beam or fore or aft.  \n  6. The combination with a boat; of a netsupporter comprising a wooden roller 10 having a flange 11 at each end formed with the inner side surface conical, bracket-stand 12 consisting of a shank 15 having a stem 16 and arms 24 each formed with upwardly-extending stems 23 having journal-apertures at the upper ends, lug-screws 26 fittingin said journals and screwed into the ends of said roller, a socket-plate 18 seated on the stern of said boat and having a downwardly-projecting flange 19 and asquare socket 17 in said plate and flange adapted to removably seat said stem 16 with the shank of said bracket extending to either beam or fore or aft.  \n  Signed at Seattle, Washington, this 24th day of April, 1902.  \n \u0026#39; LUTHER EINARSON.  \n Witnesses:  \n W.

It is preferably cooked in as small a quantity of water as possible in order that when done it may be nearly dry. It is then taken out andspread upon cloths or.trays and dried in any suitable manner by ordinary driers or in the sun. It is then parched and raised by being placed upon sand (or similar substance) which has been heated \u0026#39;to ahigh temperature. In practice we place a quantity of sand in the bottom of an. iron kettle or vessel and heat the same to a high temperature and then spread a quantity of the prepared rice thinly over said I sand. The action of the heat and the granular surface raises and parches said rice suitably. Said rice is then separated from the sand in any suitable manner, as by screening, when 1t is in a\u0026#39;condltion for use. It may be served with sugar and cream, as are ordinary breakfast-foods, or it may be made into cakes by use of adhesive substance such as is ordinarily employed in the manufacture of popcorn cakes. Rice thus prepared may be used in a variety of ways, the invention consisting in its preparation to this point, which has heretofore been avery diflicult matter to accomplish.  \n  Having thus fully described our said invention, what we claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1.

FULLER, OF CHELSEA, MASSACHUSETTS.  \n PUMP ATTACHMENT.  \n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent N0. 749,797, dated January 19, 1904.  \n i Application filed June 8, 1903. Serial No. 160,503. (No model.)  \n To all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known thatLEARLE F. KIMBALL, a citizen of the United States, residing at Chelsea, in the county of Suifolk and State of Massachusetts, have invented an Improvement in Pump Attachments, of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specification, like numerals on the drawings representing like parts.  \n  This invention relates to a device which is designed to facilitate the\u0026#39; operation of packing the piston-rods of steam-pumps and similar devices.  \n  When the piston-rod of a steam-pump needs repacking, it becomes necessary to shift the position of said rod so as to carry any nuts, collars, or other connecting devices on the piston-rod far enough away from the stuffingbox which is to be repacked to permit the collar or sleeve of the stufling box to be re moved. This is sometimes a rather difficult operation, owing to the lack of proper tools.  \n  My invention is designed to provide a simple device which can be easily attached to the pump and by means of which the position of the pump-piston may be readily shifted.  \n  The invention comprises a fulcrum-block which is adapted to be clamped to the frame of the pump and a bar or lever fulcrumed on said block and which is adapted to engage either the collar or nut on the pump-piston or to engage the rocker-arm or any other part connected to the piston for the purpose of shifting the position of the piston.  \n  In the drawings, Figure 1 is a view of a pump, showing my attachment applied thereto, the portion of the pump having the attachment applied being shown in section. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of my improved attachment, showing part of the pump-frame and part of the piston-rod of the pump in dotted lines. Fig. 3 is a side elevation of a pump having my improvement applied thereto. Fig. 4 is a modified form of fulcrum-pin.  \n  My attachment is adapted to be used in connection with any steam-pump, and in Fig. 1 of the drawings I have illustrated a duplex pump. The invention is not limited in its use to this character of pump, however.  \n  The fulcrum-block is designated by 3 and is made in the form of a clamp, which is adapted to be clamped in any suitable position upon the frame 4 of the pump. The form of block herein illustrated has the fixed clamping-jaw 5 and the movable clampingjaw 6, which plays back and forth in suitable guides \u0026#39;7 in the stem 8 of the block. The jaw 6 is given its movement by means of an adjusting-screw 9, which operates in a plate or head 10, integral with the stem 8. The active faces of the jaws 5 and 6 may be roughened or corrugated, as at 11, in order to afford a better grip upon the pump-frame.  \n  Fulcrumed to the fulcrum-block is a lever or bar 12, by means of which the piston is given its desired movement. Any suitable means for fulcruming the lever on the fulcrum-block may be employed.  \n  In the form of myinvention shown in Figs. 1 and 2 I have illustrated \u0026#39;a fulcrum-pin 14:, carried by the block, which pin extends into or through a slot 15 in the lever or bar 12, said pin forming a fulcrum for the lever.  \n  To adapt the attachment for use with different styles and constructions ofpump, I make the pin 14 adjustable in the fulcrum-block,  \n As herein shown, the fulcrum-block is provided with the bevel-face 16 and with the horizontal face 17 and in each of said faces will be formed one or more holes or sockets 18, into which the pin 14 may be inserted. In Figs. 1 and 2 I have illustrated the pin as being inserted in the holes in the inclined surface 16. If the portion of the pump-frame to which the clamp was secured stood lower with reference to the piston-rod than is shown in Fig. 1, the pin could be placed in the apertures in the horizontal face 17.  \n  In Fig. 4 I have illustrated a diflerent form of pin, which has an eye or loop 19, through which any ordinary round bar may be inserted. This construction has the advantage that no special form of bar is necessary.  \n In using my invention the fulcrum-block may be clamped to the pump-frame in the proper position, as illustrated in Fig. 1, and the fulcrum-pin 14 inserted in that aperture 18 which will enable the lever 12 to operate most efficiently. Thereafter the lever is fulcrumed on the pin, and the end of the lever brought to bear either against the collar or nut 20 on the piston-rod 21 or against the rocker-arm 22 or against any other part of the pump which is connected to the piston-rod and through which motion can be cornmunicated to said piston-rod.  \n  Since the fulcrum-block for the time being furnishes a fixed fulcrum for the lever, the piston-rod may be readily shifted into a position which will permit the stufiing-box to be properly packed. The nature of the fulcrumblock is such that it may be clamped to the pump-frame of any style of pump, and by providing it with a plurality of holes in different relative positions the lever 12 may be adjusted to operate on any pump.  \n  While I have herein shown one particular form of fulcrum-block, I wish it understood that the shape of this block may be varied in many ways without departing from the invention, as it may be necessary to vary the shape in some particulars to accommodate certain styles of pump. The essential feature of the invention, however, is a fulcrum-block which is adapted to be clamped to the frame of the pump and a. lever fulcrumed on said block.  \n  Having described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, 1s-  \n  1. In a device of the class described, a fulcrum-block adapted to be clamped to the frame of a pump, and a lever fulcrumed on said block and adapted to engage the piston-rod of the pump whereby the position of said rod may be shifted.  \n  2. In a device of the class described, a fulcrum-bloclgmeans to adjustably clamp said block to the frame of the pump, and a lever to engage and move the piston-rod fulcrumed on said block.  \n  3. In a device of the class described, a fulcrum-block, a fulcrum-pin carried by said block, means to adjustably clamp said block to the frame of the pump, and a lever fulcrumed on said pin.  \n  4. In a device of the class described, a fulcrum-block, a fulcrum-pin adjustably carried thereby, means to adjustably clamp said block to the frame of the pump, and a piston-rodmoving lever fulcrumed on said pin.  \n  In testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \n EARLE F.

JONES, OF SUGAR CREEK TOWNSHIP, MONTGOMERY COUNTY,  \n INDIANA.  \n MARKER-LIFTER FOR CORN-PLANTERS- SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 751,176, dated February 2, 1904.  \n Application filed September 28, 1903. Serial No. 174,867. (No model.)  \n To all whmn it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, OMER W. JONES, a citizen of the United States, residing in Sugar Creek township, in the county of Montgomery and State of Indiana, have invented new and useful Improvements in Marker-Lifters for Corn-Planters; and I do declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters and figures of reference marked thereon,which form a part of this specification.  \n  This invention relates to horse-power machines for planting corn, in connection with which is a marker for making lines on the ground parallel to the rows in which the corn may be planted, so that the driver of the machine may be guided by the lines in order to make all the rows parallel to one another, such markers being in common use; and the invention has reference particularly to attachments whereby the marker may be conveniently lifted so as to be reversed, or for passing obstructions, or for holding up the marker when moving the machine from field to field.  \n  The invention also has reference to improvements in the draft-rigging for the marker.  \n  The object of the invention is to provide means whereby the markers maybe reversed at the ends of the rows in a convenient manner without requiring the driver to dismount from his seat on the machine.  \n  A further object is to enable the driver to easily avoid drawing the marker against stumps or other obstructions; and a still further object is to improve the draft apparatus for the marker, so that in reversing the marker the draft-rope cannot become tangled in the framework or gearing of the machine.  \n  The invention consists in a winding-drum mounted on the machine and adapted to be operated thereby, means for throwing the drum into and out of operative engagement, a cable connecting the drum with the marker-pole, and an elevated central draft-head to which the draft-rope of the marker is connected, the draft-head also providing guides for the driving-lines.  \n Referring to the drawings, in which similar reference characters indicate like parts, Figure 1 represents a top plan view of the principal parts of a corn-planter having the improvements connected therewith; Fig. 2, a rear elevation thereof; Fig. 3, a side elevation thereof; Fig. i, a rear elevation of the draft-head detached from the machine; Fig. 5, a front elevation of the winding-drum and its connections; Fig. 6, a fragmentary sectional View longitudinally of the machine, showing an end elevation of the drum-locking wheel and side elevation of the pawl therefor; Fig. 7, a fragmentary elevation of the staff for the drafthead connected to the machine-tongue; Fig. 8, a top plan of the draft-head, and Fig. 9 a central longitudinal sectional view of the drum on its operating-shaft.  \n  In the drawings only so much of the cornplanteris illustrated as will serve to identify the character of implement to which the invention is applicable, the devices for adjusting the height of the runners being omitted, having no connection with the present invention. The popular type of planter herein illustrated includes carrying-wheels a a, an axle 6, main frame 0, tongue cl, runners e e, seed-hoppers ff, hopper-frames g g, and drivers seat it, supported by suitable means, as an arch z\u0026#39; and brace 7\u0026#39;, a swivel-jaw k at the rear of the main frame below the rear of the seat, a markerpole Z, connected to the swivel-jaw, and a suitable marker m, attached to the end of the pole. Various dropping devices are too well known to require description herein.  \n  In a practical embodiment of the invention a winding-drum A is mounted rotatively on a rotative shaft of the machine, in the present case on the axle or shaft 6, which is adapted to be rotated by one of the carrying-wheels, which is preferable to the plan of providing a separate shaft for the drum. A ratchetwheel B, having teeth a, is suitably secured to one end of the drum, the wheel having a clutch-collar O attached thereto, the end of the collar having recesses p therein to receive lugs D, that project from the sides of the shaft 6, being secured thereto. \u0026#39;A spring E encircles the collar O, bearing against the wheel B and the lugs D, normally preventing engagement of the clutch devices. At the opposite end of the drum a collar F, having a hub q, is mounted movably on the shaft Z2 and may rotate with the drum when forced against it. A cross-beam Gris provided when not already employed on a machine, and is suitably secured to the main frame 0. A bracket H, having a pivot r, is secured to the beam G, and a foot-lever I is mounted on the pivot r and has a forked end .9 engaging the collar F, straddling the hub q. A bracket J is secured also to the beam G and pivotally supports a pawl K, which is normally held in engagement with the ratchet-wheel B by means of a spring t attached thereto, the pawl having a foot-lever u for disengaging it from the ratchet-wheel. A cable Lis connected to the drum A.  \n  A pulley-block M, having a guide-pulley w, is suitably suspended at the rear of the seat 72., either to a bracket \u0026#39;0, as shown, or directly to the seat. A ring N encircles the pole Z and is positioned by means of a pin 0 inserted into the pole, preventing the ring from sliding toward the swivel 7c. The cable L leads over the pulley w and is secured to the ring N, being guided to the drum by a suitable guide P, supported by the arch or other suitable means.  \n  The draft-head for the marker is supported on a staff Q, having a threaded end 03 extending through the tongue (Z and provided with locking-nuts y y bearing against the top and bottom of the tongue. The stafi\u0026#39; has a collar 1 near its upper end. The head comprises a body R, having an opening 2, and rests on the collar 1, the top of the staff being upset to retain the body on the staff. The head is provided with a pair of wings S S, in which are openings 3 and 4:, through which the drivinglines may be passed. Above the wings is a groove T, in which the draft-rope V is connected to the head, so as to be practically swiveled thereto. A pair of brace-rods U U are connected in eyes 5 and 6 to the wings S S,  \n .and also to the frames 9 g in any suitable manner. A ring IN encircles the pole Z and is positioned by means of a pin X, inserted in the pole, and the rope V is connected to the ring. If preferred, the rope may beconnected directly with the marker m.  \n  It should be understood that the structure as described is adapted to be applied to machines now in use, and may be slightly modified when applied to new machines, as various old forms of clutches may be provided for the winding-drum, if desired, within the scope of the invention.  \n  In practical use the marker may of course operate at either side of the machine, as will be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the draft-rope Vremaining connected to the draft-head. If it is desired to elevate the marker when the machine is in motion, the driver may press a foot upon the lever I, causing the clutch-collar 0 to engage the lugs D, thus setting the drum in motion, winding the cable L, and thereby raising the marker. WVhen sufliciently high, the leverI should be released, when the spring E will force the clutch-collar C out of engagement with the lugs D, the pawl K holding the drum against unwinding. By pressing the lever a of the pawl the drum may be released to permit the marker to descend. In this manner the marker may be elevated at the rear of the drivers seat at the end of a row, and after turning the machine the driver may push the marker-pole beyond the perpendicular position, trip the pawl, and thus permit the marker to descend in reversed order. In reversing the position of the marker, the draft-rope will be carried clear of the machinery and without interfering with the lines or with the drivers person.  \n  Having thus described the invention, what I claim as new is- 1. A corn planter including a frame, a marker-pole carrying a marker swiveled to the frame, a rotative shaft, a winding-drum mounted on the rotative shaft, and a cable connected with the drum and also with the marker-pole.  \n  2. A corn-planter marker provided with a lifting-cable, a winding-drum to which the cable is connected, a clutch for the drum, and a guide for the cable.  \n  3. A corn-planter marker provided with a lifting-cable, a winding-drum to which the cable is connected, gearing for driving the drum, a guide for the cable, and a latch for temporarily holding the drum and preventing reverse movements thereof.  \n  4. A corn planter including a swiveled marker-pole, a cable-guide supported in a plane above the swivel of the pole, a cable connected to the pole and leading over the cable-guide, a winding-drum to which the cable is connected, and gearing for actuating the drum.  \n  5. A corn-planter including a rotative shaft, a winding-drum rotative on the shaft, clutching devices cooperating with the drum and the shaft, a lever for actuating the clutching devices, a latch for the drum, 2. marker-pole provided with a lifting-cable connected to the drum, and a guide-pulley engaging the cable in a plane above the normal position of the marker-pole.  \n  6. A corn planter including a frame, a tongue, a reversible marker, a staff mounted on the tongue and provided with a combined draft-head and line-guide comprising wings having openings therein at opposite sides of the staff, and a draft-rope for the marker connected to the top of said head above said wings.  \n  7. A corn-planter including a frame, a reversible marker provided with a lifting-cable, a winding-drum to which the cable is connected, a draft-head having a pair of wings having openings therein at opposite sides thereof, and a draft-rope for the marker connected to said head above said wings.  \n  8. In a corn-planter, the combination with a rotative shaft and a marker-pole connected with the planter, of a winding-drum rotative on the shaft, a cable connected to the drum and also to the marker-pole, a guide-pulley for the cable, a guide for the cable leading the same to the drum, a clutch mechanism cooperating with the drum and the shaft, a footlcver connected with the clutch mechanism, a latch cooperating with the drum, a draft-rope","language":"en","truncated":false}],"description_localized_html":[{"text":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e PATENTED FEB. 2, 1904. 0.

COREY, a citizen of the United States, residing at Schenectady, in the county of Schenectady, State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Motormens Valves, of which the following is a specification.  \n \u0026#39; My invention relates to valves employed by engineers and motormen for controlling the application and release of brakes in so-called automatic systemsthat is, systems in which the brakes are applied by reductions in the pressure of the air in the train-pipe in contradistinction to systems in which the brakes are applied by increasing said pressure-and, generally stated, it comprises a valve structure in\u0026#34; which the usual feed-valve and its operating mechanism are located directly beneath the main rotary valve and are inclosed therewith in a common casing in such a manner as to form, with the necessary communicating air-passages and connections, a compact structure. Two forms of such a valve structure are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 to 5, inclusive, illustrate one form, and Figs. 6to 8, inclusive, the other. Of the figures illustrating the first form Fig. 1 is a vertical section of the complete valve structure. Fig. 2 is a plan view of the valve-bonnet, showing in broken lines the various positions of the valve-handle corresponding to different operative positions of the valve. Fig. 3 is a top view of the valve-body, the bonnet and rotary valve being removed. Fig. 4: is avertical section of said body, taken on the line 1 4 of Fig. 3; and Fig. 5 is a similar section taken on the line 5 5 of Fig. 3. Of the figures illustrating the second form Fig. 6 is a vertical section of the complete-structure. Fig. 7 is a top view with the bonnet and, rotary valve removed; and Fig. 8 is a vertical section of the body and seat, taken on the line 8 8 of Fig. 7 Fig. 9 is a top view of the rotary valve and its stem, which are common to both forms; and Figs. 10. to 14, inclusive, are diagrammatic views illustrating the relative positions of the main valve and Valve-seat Serial No. 162,023. (No model.)  \n ports in the various operative positions of said valve.  \n \u0026#39; Each of these valve structures consists, essentially, of a central portion or body provided with suitable chambers and ports, a rotary valve seated upon the upper side of .said body and adapted to cooperate with ports therein, a feed-valve located within the inte: \u0026#39;rior of said body,-operating mechanism for said feed-valve located partly within said body and partly within \u0026#39;a tubular extension at the lower side thereof, and a bonnet which incloses the rotary valve and completes the casing of the structure.  \n  Referring to the drawings, in which like characters refer to like parts throughout the several views, and for the present to Figs. 1 to 5, inclusive, 10 designates the :central or body portion of the valve structure, which is provided with main-reservoir, atmosphere, and train pipe connections R A T at its lower side, which communicate through passages R A T to the ports-R A T upon its upper face. These ports cooperate with the valveports P and P inthe rotary-valve 11 in the operation of charging and discharging the train-pipe. with a central projection 12, which engagesa -central socket in the upper face of the valve- The rotary valve 11 is provided body and which serves as a pivot about which on the handle 14 is adapted to engage to in-\u0026#39; dicate to the motorman the various positions of the rotary valve. This is accomplished by the pawl 17 engaging the shoulders 18, 19, and 20 onsaid flange, and the\u0026#39;extreme positions are indicated by the projection 21 on the under side of the handle\u0026#39;engaging the stops 22 and 23. In order that the handle may be removed, a notch are provided in the flange 16, through which the projection 21 may pass. The passages R and T in the valve-body are in direct communication with the pipes Ur G which extend upward and are adapted to be connected to a suitable pressure-gage. The interior of the central or body portion of the valve structure is provided with a chamber 25, which is in constant communication with the main reservoir through the passage R, as clearly illustrated in Fig. 5. Another chamber, 26, located within the interior of said body below the chamber 25, is adapted to be placed in direct communication with the trainpipe through the feed-portF and the ports of the rotary valve 11. A winged feed-valve 27 controls a passage between the chamber 25 and the chamber 26 and is operated by a wellknown form of mechanism which comprises a piston 28, which is subjected to the train-pipe pressure in the chamber 26 on its upper side and to the pressure of a spring 29 on its under side. The usual flexible diaphragm 30 is composed of rubber or other suitable material which allows the piston considerable vertical movement. The spring 29 is coiled about the piston-rod 31, and both are inclosed within a tube 32, which is secured to the under side of the body 10 and forms a continuation of the valve structure. In the operation of this form of valve it will be seen that when the chamber 26 is in direct communication with the train-pipe the piston 28 will be pressed down slightly to compress the spring 29 and the feed-valve 27 will be closed. If, however, the pressure in the chamber 26 drops by reason of any leakage in the train-pipe or for other cause, the spring 29 will force the piston upward, and the upper end of the piston-rod 31 will engage the lower end of the valve 27 and open it, and air at main-reservoir pressure will then pass from the chamber 25 to the chamber 26 and thence to train-pipe and continue to pass until the pressure becomes sufficient to force the piston downward to the aforesaid balanced position.  \n  Referring to that form of my invention shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8,\u0026#39;it may be noted that the location of the ports in the rotary valve-seat and the structure of the rotary valve are essentially the same as in the corresponding parts in the form previously described. Instead, however, of a single solid piece constituting the central portion of the structure there is in this form a body 33 and a separate piece 34, constituting the rotary valve-seat. The bonnet 35 is also slightly difl\u0026#39;erent in form, having an annular portion 36, which surrounds the valve-seat 34 and serves to hold it in place when the bonnet is bolted in place. In this form the main-reservoir, atmosphere, and train-pipe connections R A T are similarly connected to the under side of the body 33 and connect with the valveseat ports R A T through corresponding passages R A T in the valve-body 33 and the seat 34. In this form of the invention, however, the feed-valve is somewhat different than that previously described and its working parts are smaller, so that this form of the in vention is more compact. This difference is brought about by employing a sheet-metal diaphragm 37 instead of the flexible rubber diaphragm of the previous form. The metal diaphragm is capable of only a slight vertical movement, and consequently in order to provide a sufliciently large opening between the reservoir and train-pipe by way of the feedvalve it is necessary to provide a double-ported feed-valve 38. The spring 39, which acts on the under side of the piston 40, which bears against the diaphragm 37 is also smaller than the corresponding spring in the other form, and I am also enabled to employ a comparatively smaller inclosing tube 41 at the under side of the valve-body 33. The double feedvalve is located within the interior of the central portion of the valve structure, which comprises the body 33 and the seat 34 and is arranged to cooperate with three chambers an intermediate chamber 42, which is in direct communication with the main reservoir through the passage R an upper chamber 43, and a lower chamber 44-which are in direct communication with each other through a vertical passage 45 in the double feed-valve 38. The feed-valve which controls passages between the intermediate chamber and said upper and lower chambers is provided with two seats 46 and 47, which are adapted to be engaged by two flanges 48 and 49, respectively. A spring 50 bears against the upper side of the valve and when unrestrained holds the flanges in contact with their seats. In the operation of this form of my invention it will be seen that when the valve-port P overlies the port F, so as to bring the train-pipe and the chamber 43 into direct communication, any falling ofi of pressure in the train-pipe will be communicated immediately to the chamber 43 and thence through the passage 45 in the feed-valve to the chamber 44, and this will leave the spring 39 free to force the feed-valve open. Air at main-reservoir pressure may then pass from the chamber 42 by two paths to the chamber 43. One of these paths extends between the flange 49 and the seat 47 and thence through the passage 45 in the feed-valve to the chamber 43, and the other path extends between the lower face of the seat 46 and the flange 49 and thence upward between the interior of said seat and the exterior of the upper portion to the feedvalve and finally between the upper face of said seat and the flange 48 to the. feed-valve. As in the previous case, compressed air will continue to flow from main reservoir to train pipe until the train-pipe pressure has in creased sufli\u0026#39;ciently to return the diaphragm 37 and its piston to their balanced position.  \n  As is usual in valves of this type, the handle 14 can be removed only when the rotary valve is in the lap position, which occurs when the projection 21 on the under side of the handle is in line with the notch 2A in the flange 16. For all other positions of the rotary valve the projection 21 would interfere with the flange 16 if it were attempted to remove the handle. In the lap position, which is that indicated in Fig. 13, none of the ports in the valve register or overlap the ports in the valve-seat, so that all communication between the train-pipe, main reservoir, and atmosphere is cut off. In the operation of the aforesaid valves when all air is off the system the feed-valve will be open, so that as soon as the compressor is started to bring the main reservoir up to pressure compressed air will be fed to all the chambers in the central portion of the structure, and when the pres: sure on the upper side of the feed-valve piston has increased sufficiently it will compress its spring and allow the feed-valve to close in the manner previously set out. With the chambers thus charged if it is desired to start the car or train the handle is placed in position on the valve-stem in the manner previ ously described and the valve is removed from lap to release position. When the latter position is reached, it is indicated to the motorman by the pawl 17 engaging the shoul-.  \n der 18 on the flange 16 and the projection 21 engaging the stop 22. In this position of the valve the ports P and I? register with the seat-ports R and T thus connecting the trainpipe to the main reservoir through a wide opening, and compressed air will rush into the train-pipe from the main reservoir.  \n  In the usual operation the rotary valve will be retained in the release position only for a suflicient time to allow the pressure of the air in the train-pipe to rise sufliciently to actuate the triple valves and release the brakes, and after this itwill be returned to the running position, in which any small deficiency of pressure that may exist will be made up.  \n  In the running position the port P will lie directly above the seat-port F and the port P will only slightly overlap the port T, as is clearly illustrated in Fig. 11, so that all air which enters the train-pipe must pass through the passage controlled by the feed-valve. In this operation, as previously indicated, the train-pipe pressure is balanced against the piston-spring, so that whenever the pressure in the train-pipe is below normal the feedvalve is opened and air flows from the main reservoir to the train-pipe and continues to flow until the pressure is restored. Thus the train-pipe is automatically fed and the pressure maintained normal as long as the main valve remains in the running position. In moving the valve from the release to the running position the latter position is indicated tothe motorman or engineer by the engagement of the pawl 17 of the handle-with the shoulder 19 of the flange 16.  \n  When it is desired to make an ordinary service application of the brakes, the valve-handle is moved from the running position beyond the lap position until one or more of the ports Pco\u0026#39;mes directly above the trainpipe port T and the valve-port P overlaps the. atmospheric port A This will provide a passage, more or less constricted, between train-pipe and atmosphere and air will escape with suflicient rapidity to actuate the triple valves and produce the necessary application of the brakes. The degree of application will depend upon the number of ports P which overlie the train-pipeport T When the most severe service application is obtained. the ports will be in the position indicated in Fig. 12, and in reaching such position the pawl 17 on the handle will strike the shoulder 20 on the flange 16, and thus indicate to the motorman that further movement is unnecessary for an ordinary application. Finally, if it is desired to make an emergency application of the brakes the handle 1 1 is thrown around to the extreme right until the projection 21 engages the stop 23. In this position of the valve,  \n which is indicated in Fig. 14, the valve-ports I\u0026#34; and P register with the train-pipe port T and atmospheric port A\u0026#34;, respectively, thus providing a wide opening between train-pipe and the atmosphere, through which air may escape with suflicient rapidity to produce a sudden and strong application of the brakes. After either a service or emergency application the brakes are released by moving the handle around to the. release position and subsequently to the running position after charging the train-pipe to release the brakes in the manner previously described. The particular feed-valve and feed-valveoperating mechanism illustrated in Fig. 6\u0026#39; constitutes no part of my invention, but forms the subject-matter or\u0026#34; application, Serial No. 169,577, filed August 16, 1903, by George Macloskie. a What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States, is 1.

COREY, a citizen of the United States, residing at Schenectady, in the county of Schenectady, State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Motormens Valves, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e' My invention relates to valves employed by engineers and motormen for controlling the application and release of brakes in so-called automatic systemsthat is, systems in which the brakes are applied by reductions in the pressure of the air in the train-pipe in contradistinction to systems in which the brakes are applied by increasing said pressure-and, generally stated, it comprises a valve structure in\" which the usual feed-valve and its operating mechanism are located directly beneath the main rotary valve and are inclosed therewith in a common casing in such a manner as to form, with the necessary communicating air-passages and connections, a compact structure. Two forms of such a valve structure are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 to 5, inclusive, illustrate one form, and Figs. 6to 8, inclusive, the other. Of the figures illustrating the first form Fig. 1 is a vertical section of the complete valve structure. Fig. 2 is a plan view of the valve-bonnet, showing in broken lines the various positions of the valve-handle corresponding to different operative positions of the valve. Fig. 3 is a top view of the valve-body, the bonnet and rotary valve being removed. Fig. 4: is avertical section of said body, taken on the line 1 4 of Fig. 3; and Fig. 5 is a similar section taken on the line 5 5 of Fig. 3. Of the figures illustrating the second form Fig. 6 is a vertical section of the complete-structure. Fig. 7 is a top view with the bonnet and, rotary valve removed; and Fig. 8 is a vertical section of the body and seat, taken on the line 8 8 of Fig. 7 Fig. 9 is a top view of the rotary valve and its stem, which are common to both forms; and Figs. 10. to 14, inclusive, are diagrammatic views illustrating the relative positions of the main valve and Valve-seat Serial No. 162,023. (No model.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eports in the various operative positions of said valve. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e' Each of these valve structures consists, essentially, of a central portion or body provided with suitable chambers and ports, a rotary valve seated upon the upper side of .said body and adapted to cooperate with ports therein, a feed-valve located within the inte: 'rior of said body,-operating mechanism for said feed-valve located partly within said body and partly within 'a tubular extension at the lower side thereof, and a bonnet which incloses the rotary valve and completes the casing of the structure. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring to the drawings, in which like characters refer to like parts throughout the several views, and for the present to Figs. 1 to 5, inclusive, 10 designates the :central or body portion of the valve structure, which is provided with main-reservoir, atmosphere, and train pipe connections R A T at its lower side, which communicate through passages R A T to the ports-R A T upon its upper face. These ports cooperate with the valveports P and P inthe rotary-valve 11 in the operation of charging and discharging the train-pipe. with a central projection 12, which engagesa -central socket in the upper face of the valve- The rotary valve 11 is provided body and which serves as a pivot about which on the handle 14 is adapted to engage to in-' dicate to the motorman the various positions of the rotary valve. This is accomplished by the pawl 17 engaging the shoulders 18, 19, and 20 onsaid flange, and the'extreme positions are indicated by the projection 21 on the under side of the handle'engaging the stops 22 and 23. In order that the handle may be removed, a notch are provided in the flange 16, through which the projection 21 may pass. The passages R and T in the valve-body are in direct communication with the pipes Ur G which extend upward and are adapted to be connected to a suitable pressure-gage. The interior of the central or body portion of the valve structure is provided with a chamber 25, which is in constant communication with the main reservoir through the passage R, as clearly illustrated in Fig. 5. Another chamber, 26, located within the interior of said body below the chamber 25, is adapted to be placed in direct communication with the trainpipe through the feed-portF and the ports of the rotary valve 11. A winged feed-valve 27 controls a passage between the chamber 25 and the chamber 26 and is operated by a wellknown form of mechanism which comprises a piston 28, which is subjected to the train-pipe pressure in the chamber 26 on its upper side and to the pressure of a spring 29 on its under side. The usual flexible diaphragm 30 is composed of rubber or other suitable material which allows the piston considerable vertical movement. The spring 29 is coiled about the piston-rod 31, and both are inclosed within a tube 32, which is secured to the under side of the body 10 and forms a continuation of the valve structure. In the operation of this form of valve it will be seen that when the chamber 26 is in direct communication with the train-pipe the piston 28 will be pressed down slightly to compress the spring 29 and the feed-valve 27 will be closed. If, however, the pressure in the chamber 26 drops by reason of any leakage in the train-pipe or for other cause, the spring 29 will force the piston upward, and the upper end of the piston-rod 31 will engage the lower end of the valve 27 and open it, and air at main-reservoir pressure will then pass from the chamber 25 to the chamber 26 and thence to train-pipe and continue to pass until the pressure becomes sufficient to force the piston downward to the aforesaid balanced position. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring to that form of my invention shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8,'it may be noted that the location of the ports in the rotary valve-seat and the structure of the rotary valve are essentially the same as in the corresponding parts in the form previously described. Instead, however, of a single solid piece constituting the central portion of the structure there is in this form a body 33 and a separate piece 34, constituting the rotary valve-seat. The bonnet 35 is also slightly difl'erent in form, having an annular portion 36, which surrounds the valve-seat 34 and serves to hold it in place when the bonnet is bolted in place. In this form the main-reservoir, atmosphere, and train-pipe connections R A T are similarly connected to the under side of the body 33 and connect with the valveseat ports R A T through corresponding passages R A T in the valve-body 33 and the seat 34. In this form of the invention, however, the feed-valve is somewhat different than that previously described and its working parts are smaller, so that this form of the in vention is more compact. This difference is brought about by employing a sheet-metal diaphragm 37 instead of the flexible rubber diaphragm of the previous form. The metal diaphragm is capable of only a slight vertical movement, and consequently in order to provide a sufliciently large opening between the reservoir and train-pipe by way of the feedvalve it is necessary to provide a double-ported feed-valve 38. The spring 39, which acts on the under side of the piston 40, which bears against the diaphragm 37 is also smaller than the corresponding spring in the other form, and I am also enabled to employ a comparatively smaller inclosing tube 41 at the under side of the valve-body 33. The double feedvalve is located within the interior of the central portion of the valve structure, which comprises the body 33 and the seat 34 and is arranged to cooperate with three chambers an intermediate chamber 42, which is in direct communication with the main reservoir through the passage R an upper chamber 43, and a lower chamber 44-which are in direct communication with each other through a vertical passage 45 in the double feed-valve 38. The feed-valve which controls passages between the intermediate chamber and said upper and lower chambers is provided with two seats 46 and 47, which are adapted to be engaged by two flanges 48 and 49, respectively. A spring 50 bears against the upper side of the valve and when unrestrained holds the flanges in contact with their seats. In the operation of this form of my invention it will be seen that when the valve-port P overlies the port F, so as to bring the train-pipe and the chamber 43 into direct communication, any falling ofi of pressure in the train-pipe will be communicated immediately to the chamber 43 and thence through the passage 45 in the feed-valve to the chamber 44, and this will leave the spring 39 free to force the feed-valve open. Air at main-reservoir pressure may then pass from the chamber 42 by two paths to the chamber 43. One of these paths extends between the flange 49 and the seat 47 and thence through the passage 45 in the feed-valve to the chamber 43, and the other path extends between the lower face of the seat 46 and the flange 49 and thence upward between the interior of said seat and the exterior of the upper portion to the feedvalve and finally between the upper face of said seat and the flange 48 to the. feed-valve. As in the previous case, compressed air will continue to flow from main reservoir to train pipe until the train-pipe pressure has in creased sufli'ciently to return the diaphragm 37 and its piston to their balanced position. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e As is usual in valves of this type, the handle 14 can be removed only when the rotary valve is in the lap position, which occurs when the projection 21 on the under side of the handle is in line with the notch 2A in the flange 16. For all other positions of the rotary valve the projection 21 would interfere with the flange 16 if it were attempted to remove the handle. In the lap position, which is that indicated in Fig. 13, none of the ports in the valve register or overlap the ports in the valve-seat, so that all communication between the train-pipe, main reservoir, and atmosphere is cut off. In the operation of the aforesaid valves when all air is off the system the feed-valve will be open, so that as soon as the compressor is started to bring the main reservoir up to pressure compressed air will be fed to all the chambers in the central portion of the structure, and when the pres: sure on the upper side of the feed-valve piston has increased sufficiently it will compress its spring and allow the feed-valve to close in the manner previously set out. With the chambers thus charged if it is desired to start the car or train the handle is placed in position on the valve-stem in the manner previ ously described and the valve is removed from lap to release position. When the latter position is reached, it is indicated to the motorman by the pawl 17 engaging the shoul-. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eder 18 on the flange 16 and the projection 21 engaging the stop 22. In this position of the valve the ports P and I? register with the seat-ports R and T thus connecting the trainpipe to the main reservoir through a wide opening, and compressed air will rush into the train-pipe from the main reservoir. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the usual operation the rotary valve will be retained in the release position only for a suflicient time to allow the pressure of the air in the train-pipe to rise sufliciently to actuate the triple valves and release the brakes, and after this itwill be returned to the running position, in which any small deficiency of pressure that may exist will be made up. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the running position the port P will lie directly above the seat-port F and the port P will only slightly overlap the port T, as is clearly illustrated in Fig. 11, so that all air which enters the train-pipe must pass through the passage controlled by the feed-valve. In this operation, as previously indicated, the train-pipe pressure is balanced against the piston-spring, so that whenever the pressure in the train-pipe is below normal the feedvalve is opened and air flows from the main reservoir to the train-pipe and continues to flow until the pressure is restored. Thus the train-pipe is automatically fed and the pressure maintained normal as long as the main valve remains in the running position. In moving the valve from the release to the running position the latter position is indicated tothe motorman or engineer by the engagement of the pawl 17 of the handle-with the shoulder 19 of the flange 16. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e When it is desired to make an ordinary service application of the brakes, the valve-handle is moved from the running position beyond the lap position until one or more of the ports Pco'mes directly above the trainpipe port T and the valve-port P overlaps the. atmospheric port A This will provide a passage, more or less constricted, between train-pipe and atmosphere and air will escape with suflicient rapidity to actuate the triple valves and produce the necessary application of the brakes. The degree of application will depend upon the number of ports P which overlie the train-pipeport T When the most severe service application is obtained. the ports will be in the position indicated in Fig. 12, and in reaching such position the pawl 17 on the handle will strike the shoulder 20 on the flange 16, and thus indicate to the motorman that further movement is unnecessary for an ordinary application. Finally, if it is desired to make an emergency application of the brakes the handle 1 1 is thrown around to the extreme right until the projection 21 engages the stop 23. In this position of the valve, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhich is indicated in Fig. 14, the valve-ports I\" and P register with the train-pipe port T and atmospheric port A\", respectively, thus providing a wide opening between train-pipe and the atmosphere, through which air may escape with suflicient rapidity to produce a sudden and strong application of the brakes. After either a service or emergency application the brakes are released by moving the handle around to the. release position and subsequently to the running position after charging the train-pipe to release the brakes in the manner previously described.

Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional elevation of the burner on an enlarged scale. Figs. 3 and A are detail perspective views of parts of the burner.  \n  Referring to the drawings, 1 indicates a stove, which may be of any suitable or desired construction, with the exception of the grate 2, which in accordance with our invention comprises a horizontal sheet-metal base having an orifice 3 formed centrally therein, the plate adjacent to the edge of this orifice being grooved or channeled, as at A, to receive any oil which may possibly escape to the same. Mounted upon the base-plate is a shield 5, preferably cylindrical in form and of a diameter sufficiently large to admit of its surrounding the channel A in the base-plate. The shield is preferably formed integral with the baseplate by casting or otherwise, but may, if so desired, be made separate therefrom and attached in any suitable manner. Mounted upon the plate and within the shield are aplurality of vertical lugs 6, adapted to receive and support the burner proper, 7. This burner preferably comprises an annular metal disk having a groove 8 formed upon its upper face near its periphery and is of a size sufiicient to extend beyond the edges of the orifice 3 in the base-plate above which the burner is sus- Serial No. 141,597. (No model.)  \n tained by means of the lugs 6, the burner being maintained distant from the base-plate and also from the inner walls of the shield 5.  \n  9 is an oil-pipe which projects into the stove, preferably through the side wall of the same, in position to deliver the oil onto the upper face of the burner.  \n  10 is a steam-pipe which enters the casing of the stove from beneath, with its end projecting vertically upward through the orifice 3 in the base-plate and close up to the under side of the burner in position to deliver the steam directly onto the same and beneath the burner.  \n  In assembling the parts the shield, which is formed integral with or connected to the baseplate in any suitable manner, surrounds the central orifice and also the groove 4:. The burner is then mounted upon the vertical lugs 6 and is supported solely thereby over the orifice and distant from the base-plate and from the sides of the shield, as clearly shown in Fig. 2.  \n  In operation the oil is conducted through \u0026#39;pipe 11 and delivered upon the upper face of the burner. WVhen the burner has become sufficiently flooded, the flow of oil is cut off, and the oil upon the surface of the burner is lighted\u0026#39;to heat the burner, as usual. WVhen the burner is first flooded with oil, the latter will be received in the groove 8 and any oil escaping therefrom and falling upon the baseplate will be received by the groove 4. After the burner has become sufliciently heated the oil is again turned on and vaporizes in the usual manner for ignition. Steam is delivered through pipe 10 beneath the burner and directly against its lower surface, and the steam coming in contact with the hot metal of the burner is thoroughly dried and heated before passing upward around the edges of the same and mingling with the oil-vapor. Air entering through the central orifice in the base-plate also contacts with the lower heated surface of the burner and is thoroughly heated before passing upward around the same and mixing with the steam and oil-vapor, thus insuring a thorough commingling of the vapors and a perfect combustion.  \n From the foregoing it will be seen that we by our construction produce a device of extreme simplicity, one which will be inexpensive to manufacture and in which both the air and steam will be thoroughly heated and dried before mixing with the oil-vapor to insure a more perfect combustion, and in attaining these ends we do not limit or confine ourselves to the precise details herein shown and described, as various changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit or scope of our invention.  \n  Having thus described our invention, what we claim is 1. In an oil-burner, the combination with a horizontal base-plate having an air-inlet orifice formed therethrough, of a vertical shield mounted on the upper face of the base-plate and surrounding the orifice, a horizontallydisposed disklying wholly Within the shield and sustained above the orifice and distant from the base, means for delivering oil to the upper face of the disk, and a pipe extending through the orifice in the base-plate for delivering steam directly beneath the disk, said pipe being of lesser diameter than the diameter of the orifice to permit free passage of air through the latter.  \n  2. In an oil-burner, the combination with a horizontal base-plate having an air-inlet orifice formed therethrough and a groove in its upper face surrounding the orifice, a vertical shield mounted on the upper face of the baseplate and surrounding the groove, vertical lugs associated with the interior of the shield, a horizontally-disposed disk removably supported by the lugs wholly within the shield, said disk being disposed above the orifice and distant from the base-plate and wall of the shield, means for delivering oil to the upper face of the disk, and a pipe extending through the orifice in the base-plate for delivering steam directly beneath the disk, said pipe being of lesser diameter than the diameter of the orifice to permit free passage of air through the latter.  \n  In testimony that we claim the foregoing as our own we have hereto affixed our signatures in the presence of two witnesses.  \n GEORGE WASHINGTON BEDINGER.

PRICE, a citihave invented certain new and useful Improvements in Rubber Vehicle-Tires; and I do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in\u0026#39; the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.  \n  My invention relates to a novel construction in a rubber vehicle-tire, the object being to provide a simple and eflieient device of this character; and itcons-ists in the features of construction and combinations of partshereinafter fully described and claimed.  \n  In the accompanyingdrawings, illustrating my invention-Figure l is a\u0026#34; transverse section of my tire, showing-same before the retainingbands are sprung in place. Fig. 2 is asimilar section showing my tire after the retaining-bandsare sprung in -..place. Fig. 3 is a similar section showing a slight modification. Fig. 4 is a-similar section showing another slight modification. A  \n  In said drawings, A indicates channel of a vehicle-wheel, and B the tire, the  \n \u0026#39; base portion of which is formed to fit said rim or channel A. The saidbase portion Cis of greater =width than the tread portion of said tire, thus forming flanges D at each side-\u0026#34;of the upper portion of said base to. receive retaining wires or bands E, the latter being endless and sprung over-the flanges of the rim or channel A and bearing upon said flanges D of said tire to hold the same securely in said rim. In order to prevent said retaining wires or bands E from cutting into the rubber or working their way between the flanges of the rim retaining wires or bands E to bear directly or almost directly upon said fabric and to be 5 supported and held against displacement therethe rim or by. The ,said fabric F is preferably of a loosely-woven or open-mesh character, so that \u0026#34;in vulcanization the rubber will flow through and obtain a goodhold thereon, and, further,  \n gage wire,-so that the main pressure exerted thereby on the flanges of the tire will be inwardly from the edges of the latter and will consequently cause such wires or bands to partially embed themselves in said flanges and pinch the outer edges thereof against the flanges of the rim. The fabric will yield to such pressure and at its edges form channels in which the wires or bands will lie. Were the fabric of the closely-woven stiff nature generally employed, there would be av tendency for the tread portion of the tire to tear away from thesaid fabric; but by the employment of softer and more open fabric this difliculty is overcome by reason of the fact that the rubber obtains a firmer hold on the fabric, and, further, because the fabric yields to strains on thetread-portion and followsthe same. Below said layers E of fabric a thick layer of {rubber is interposed, and below the same is a \u0026#34;pluralityof layers G of stiff frictioned fabric,  \n which render said base laterally non-compressible. The said intervening layer of rubber serves asa cushion to enable the retaining-bands to be sprung into place and by reason of the yielding nature of the fabric E also yields to pressure on the tread portion, thereby extending-the resiliency of the tire into 7 the pressure on the base as to cause the lower layer of rubber to be spread and compressed against\u0026#39;the flanges of the rim, thus preventing moisture and dirt from entering between said tire and rim.\u0026#39;  \n  The stifl base is very advantageous, for the reason that it positively prevents local travel as is the case with the average tire, as by reason of its great stifl\u0026#39;Tness any longitudinal movement of the tire at one point wouldinvolve movement over the entire length, and this is rendered practically impossible/by the great pressure exerted on the tire by the retaining-bands.  \n  I do not desire to be understood as limiting the stiffening ofthe base to the intermolding of frictioned fabric, as the same result may be accomplished by forming said. base of a harder rubber, as shown at G in Figs; 3 and- 4, or in any other suitable manner.  \n  It frequently happens that the rims or channels of vehicle-tires vary slightly from standard sizes and that consequently the tires sometimes fit loosely therein. I prefer, there-- fore, to extend the upper layers of frictioned fabric beyond the flanges of the tire, so that if the tire fits loosely or even only snugly in the rim such projecting edges will lie in con tact with the flanges of the said rim or chan-\u0026#39; nel and extend upwardly along the same; The bands in springing over the said flanges will then compress such projecting edges very tightly against the rim or channel and will\u0026#34; serve to prevent the admission of moisture or mud between the flanges of the rim and the base of the tire and will also positively prevent the bands from working their Way between the flanges of the rim and the base of the tire. Where the tire fits sufliciently tight in said rim or channel, the said projecting edges of said fabric may be trimmed off, as shown in Fig. 2.  \n I claim as my invention 1. A vehicle-tire comprising a rubber tread portion adapted to project above the side flanges of the wheel-rim, lateral ofisets or shoulders arranged to extend opposite the upper portions of said rim-flanges and constituting at such point the widest part of the tire, soft, yielding fabric extending into said ofl\u0026#39;sets or shoulders, and a cushion of rubber at the base of said tire and beneath said fabric.  \n  2.

PRICE, a citihave invented certain new and useful Improvements in Rubber Vehicle-Tires; and I do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in' the art to which it appertains to make and use the same. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention relates to a novel construction in a rubber vehicle-tire, the object being to provide a simple and eflieient device of this character; and itcons-ists in the features of construction and combinations of partshereinafter fully described and claimed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the accompanyingdrawings, illustrating my invention-Figure l is a\" transverse section of my tire, showing-same before the retainingbands are sprung in place. Fig. 2 is asimilar section showing my tire after the retaining-bandsare sprung in -..place. Fig. 3 is a similar section showing a slight modification. Fig. 4 is a-similar section showing another slight modification. A \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In said drawings, A indicates channel of a vehicle-wheel, and B the tire, the \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e' base portion of which is formed to fit said rim or channel A. The saidbase portion Cis of greater =width than the tread portion of said tire, thus forming flanges D at each side-\"of the upper portion of said base to. receive retaining wires or bands E, the latter being endless and sprung over-the flanges of the rim or channel A and bearing upon said flanges D of said tire to hold the same securely in said rim. In order to prevent said retaining wires or bands E from cutting into the rubber or working their way between the flanges of the rim retaining wires or bands E to bear directly or almost directly upon said fabric and to be 5 supported and held against displacement therethe rim or by. The ,said fabric F is preferably of a loosely-woven or open-mesh character, so that \"in vulcanization the rubber will flow through and obtain a goodhold thereon, and, further, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egage wire,-so that the main pressure exerted thereby on the flanges of the tire will be inwardly from the edges of the latter and will consequently cause such wires or bands to partially embed themselves in said flanges and pinch the outer edges thereof against the flanges of the rim. The fabric will yield to such pressure and at its edges form channels in which the wires or bands will lie. Were the fabric of the closely-woven stiff nature generally employed, there would be av tendency for the tread portion of the tire to tear away from thesaid fabric; but by the employment of softer and more open fabric this difliculty is overcome by reason of the fact that the rubber obtains a firmer hold on the fabric, and, further, because the fabric yields to strains on thetread-portion and followsthe same. Below said layers E of fabric a thick layer of {rubber is interposed, and below the same is a \"pluralityof layers G of stiff frictioned fabric, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhich render said base laterally non-compressible. The said intervening layer of rubber serves asa cushion to enable the retaining-bands to be sprung into place and by reason of the yielding nature of the fabric E also yields to pressure on the tread portion, thereby extending-the resiliency of the tire into 7 the pressure on the base as to cause the lower layer of rubber to be spread and compressed against'the flanges of the rim, thus preventing moisture and dirt from entering between said tire and rim.' \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The stifl base is very advantageous, for the reason that it positively prevents local travel as is the case with the average tire, as by reason of its great stifl'Tness any longitudinal movement of the tire at one point wouldinvolve movement over the entire length, and this is rendered practically impossible/by the great pressure exerted on the tire by the retaining-bands. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e I do not desire to be understood as limiting the stiffening ofthe base to the intermolding of frictioned fabric, as the same result may be accomplished by forming said. base of a harder rubber, as shown at G in Figs; 3 and- 4, or in any other suitable manner. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It frequently happens that the rims or channels of vehicle-tires vary slightly from standard sizes and that consequently the tires sometimes fit loosely therein. I prefer, there-- fore, to extend the upper layers of frictioned fabric beyond the flanges of the tire, so that if the tire fits loosely or even only snugly in the rim such projecting edges will lie in con tact with the flanges of the said rim or chan-' nel and extend upwardly along the same; The bands in springing over the said flanges will then compress such projecting edges very tightly against the rim or channel and will\" serve to prevent the admission of moisture or mud between the flanges of the rim and the base of the tire and will also positively prevent the bands from working their Way between the flanges of the rim and the base of the tire. Where the tire fits sufliciently tight in said rim or channel, the said projecting edges of said fabric may be trimmed off, as shown in Fig. 2. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI claim as my invention 1. A vehicle-tire comprising a rubber tread portion adapted to project above the side flanges of the wheel-rim, lateral ofisets or shoulders arranged to extend opposite the upper portions of said rim-flanges and constituting at such point the widest part of the tire, soft, yielding fabric extending into said ofl'sets or shoulders, and a cushion of rubber at the base of said tire and beneath said fabric. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 2.

To avoid this waste, and yet obtain the curve required, I form the spring as seen in iig. 1, the one edge being of reverse form precisely as the other, so that one edge of one spring corresponds exactly to the opposite edge of another spring; that is to say, from a sheet of metal the springs are cut, as seen in g. 2, and this may be done by a shear, having its edge to correspond-to the edge of the springs, and the metal fed into the shears. The springs are successively cut from the sheet without any waste of metal, which saves a. large-expense in the cost ofthe dies, as cach dil'erent-sizedl spring, as heretofore formed, required a dieof precisely that size and form. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim as newnnduseful, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The construction of shank-springs, when eut or stamped out of the. sheet without scrap or waste, substantially as s'pecied. i \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDWARD HEATON. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWitnesses: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.

A. strip of cotton cloth is then wrapped round the whole, when the tubing thus formed is ready for curing.  \n  Various attempts-have been made, from time-to time, to establish a different mode of manufacture, by com pressing the rubber, whilein a plastic state, within a cylinder, round a. oorehaving\u0026#39;a fi\u0026#39;xed relationship to the tubing, as it is forced through a die or former out round the co\u0026#39;re; but this method, however practicable for making tubes of other plastic substance than rubber, has not\u0026#39;answered in working thislatter\u0026#39;material, by reason of the peculiar properties of such gum, wh ich make aliked core arrangement,- under such mode of operation,  \n objectionable or impracticable,\u0026#34; and the\u0026#34; tube buckling or collapsing, for want of a proper support, when or as and after it is passed out through the die. llriuch time also is\u0026#39;lost, and an inconvenient amount ofspace required under such mode of working, and thisobjection applies to tubing so made from other gums or material than rubber, by reason of the length of stroke it has heretofore been necessary to gi\u0026#39;vethe\u0026#39; compressing-ram or rams,  \n over andubove their stroke within the cylinder or cylinders, to facilitate the charging of the latter, or feeding inof the plastic\u0026#39;material in bulk. p p 4 I These objections to the system of working just referred .to, the present improvement obviates, andniy invention consists, first, in the employment of two gum-compressing rams, made-capable ofsw\u0026#39;inging on\u0026#39;a centre, as,  \n forinstance, around, as a, common axis, the hydraulic ram\u0026#39;or plunger, or extension from it, through which the necessary power andaction are communicated to ,thefgum-rams, whereby, as these\u0026#39;latterenrergefrom their cylindc\u0026#39;rs, they may, without any ex tra elevation or motion, be swung to one side, out ofthefway, arid a convenient space thereby aii\u0026#39;orderl for packing or charging the cylinders with the material to be compressed.  \n  And my invention further consists in the employment of a travellingcorc, arrangedto pass through the hollow core and die, between and at the bottom of the gummy-finders, transversely to the axial lines of the ra ns, and fed or moving along withthc tubing, as it is formed andissnes from the die, which, among other advantages, prevents buckling and collapsing, as hereinbeforc referred to. i  \n  In this description, it will snthce to speak of pure or unalioyed rubber as the gum being worked.  \n Referring to the accompanying drawing, A represents the water-ram to the machine, which Works under hydraulic pressure. B B\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;re two gum cemprcssin\u0026#39;g rams, connected therewith \u0026#34;by a central piyot or bolt, 0,  \n and looked \u0026#34;with the same, whe n making theirup and-down stroke, by a key, a, or other suitable attachment By employing two rams the gum is equally distributed on oppositesides of the core. D are the gumcylinders. Arranged across the bottom of these gum-cylinders, or in a chamber, E, at \u0026#39;footof the same, are the hollow core F and die G r, lying in the same axial positionytransversely to the axes ofthe rains, and adjustable by a screw-thread construction of them, orotherwisarelatively to each other. H is the travelling core, which passes through the core F and die G. p i i Q To charge the cylinders D D with gumor rubber, the rams B B, when elevated just so that they clear the tops of said cylinders, are detached from lock with the water-ram A, in order that they may be swung out of the way, asrepresented by red lines in fig.- 3, which leaves the cylinders clear, and gives .free and ample space 2 new for feeding in the gum without any special elevation of the rams, whereby labor and time are economized, and space necessary to work the machine reduced. And here it may be remarked that the gum, forming a tough mass, requires to be well packed\u0026#39;and kneaded into the cylinders; to expel air, which, if left, would produce holes in the tube. After the cylinders are charged, the rams B Bare swung round on their pivot, O, and locked to their place, in line with the cylinders D D, and pressure applied.  \n From this description it will be seen that the gum is, forced through between the hollow core F, on its outside, and die G, to its interior, and thus passing, is received on the travelling core H, which is carried along with and supports the rubber tube, or is\u0026#39;fed and worked so as to be delivered with the tube as it is formed and issues from the die, and which keeps the tube from injury as it passes out of the die, and from buckling or collapsing. By adjusting the hollow core F and die Grrelatively to each other, the thickness of the tube and freedom on the travelling core H may be regulated. The tubeathus formed, with the travelling core in it, is then ready for curing. The travelling core H may either be a solid rod or tube, and, if the latter, either made close or of aperforated character. The rubber tube, when cured, may be freed from \u0026#39;the trav elling core H, by  \n forcing air orwater through a connecting-coupling, constructed to spread out the end of the tube, and serving to convey\u0026#39;air or water, under pressure, through such spread-out portion, and around the core H; or where the latter is of a tubular and perforated character, by forcing air or water through it from the inside, to, in either case, separate the rubber tube from the core, or facilitateiits removal therefrom.  \n  What is here claimed, and desired to be secured by Letters Patent, is I ,1.

Fig. 2 is an elevation, enlarged somewhat over Fig. 1, showing one end of the table and devices whereby when they are set in motion are adapted to shift the table to the right or the left. Fig. 3 illustrates in section and in detail the pivot-stand upon which said table rotates. Fig. 4 is a sectional detail in elevation, showing the manner of locking the table when it is desired to connect the rails of the table Serial No. 179,465. (No model.)  \n with coadjacent rails on the surface of the grounda While I have illustrated in the accompanying drawings a rotating table, it is to be understood the power devices may be employed with equal facility on a table which is adapted to be reciprocated.  \n  In the drawings, 1 indicates a table of the usual construction set in adepression2 of the ground, the opposite ends of the table provided with one or more wheels or rollers 3, journaled in bearings L and rolling upon the tramway or track 5, secured to the base or foundation 6. The pivot-stand of the table (indicated as 7 and provided with roller-bearings 8) is one of the many forms of pivotstands that may be employed in a complete device and supported in the bottom of the depression 2. The table is provided with the usual transverse ties 9, to which the longitudinal rails 10 are secured, extending from end to end of the table and adapted to coact with rails 11 on the surface of the ground, leading off in all directions from such table.  \n 12 indicates a power-shaft extending longitudinally of the table 1 and may be supported at any point and in any suitablemanner; but I have shown the same journaled in boxings 13, supported by the ties 9, as shown, the center of the shaft passing through and operatively connected with working parts of an airmotor 14:, which may be of any suitable design and containing suflicient number of horsepower. On the opposite ends of the shaft 12 is carried a sleeve 15, feathered thereon, and secured to the sleeves are the bevel gears or frictionwheels 16 and 17, adapted to mesh with a gear 18, fixed to a\u0026#39;shaft 19, journaled in boxings 20, supported by\u0026#39;the table 1. It is adapted to shift the sleeve 15 for the purpose of interchanging the gears 16 18 and 17 18 for rotating and shifting the table in opposite directions. This is accomplished by means of the lever 21, having a pivotal connection at 22 with the table, and lower bifurcated ends 23 engaging the sleeve for the purpose of shifting the same., The lever extends up above the table a desirable distance, and combined with the usual pawl-and-rack connection for looking theposition of the sleeve 15 on the shaft 12 after shifting.  \n The gearing by which the table is propelled consists of a pinion 2 1 on the shaft 19,whioh meshes with a rack 25, seated in the wall of the depression 2 of the ground and as shown in the drawings. Thus it will be seen, power being imparted to the gears 24 by their engagement with the rack 25, the table may be shifted in opposite directions. To look the table when the rails of thetable coincide with the rails on the surface of the ground, I have provided the transverse shaft 26, journaled in the boxings, supported by the table, to which is connected a finger 27 the finger having connected therewitha link 28, which at its opposite end is attached to a rod, bar, or finger 29,  \n - slidable in a casing 30, attached to the rails ofthe table, and its free end adapted to engage the end of a rail on the surface of the ground, substantially in manner shown in Fig. 4, the means of operating the shaft- 26 being an operators lever 31, attached to one end of the shaft 26.  \n  To the motor 14 is connected the air tube or pipe 32, at its opposite ends controlled by the valves 33, and 34 indicates a lead from the pipe or tube 32, connected with an auxiliary reservoir or tank 85, supported by the table, the pipe 34 havingconnected therewith intermediate the tank and pipe 32 a valve for controlling the supply to the pipe 32. Suitable means (not shown) may be provided for filling the tank 35 with air.  \n  When an engine is run onto the table, the tube which connects with the air-supply is coupled onto one end of the pipe 32, the valve 33 opened,which imparts power to the motor 14 and through its shaft 12 to the gearing 16 and 17 and from such gearing to the pinion 24:, which shifts the table through its connection with the rack 25. If the air-supply of the engine is dead, the supply from the tank I 35 is admitted to the motor 14;, which serves in the same capacity as the air from the engine;  \n The mechanism seen in Figs. 2 and 4 is dusorted to both in the construction and arrangement of the apparatus, and I do not wish to be confined to the showing made, but to include all equivalents of such devices.  \n  Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States, is  \n  1. In combination with a transfer-table, a motor supported thereby, a shaft directly connected with the motor and extending to opposite ends of said table, a fixed cog-rack, pinions intermeshing with said rack, and means for communicating power from the motorshaft to said pinions.  \n  2. In combination, a turn-table, an air-motor supported thereby, a power-shaft connected with said motor, an air-pipe connected with said motor and adapted to be connected with an air-supply under pressure, and mechanism adapted to be intermittingly connected with said power-shaft and thereby propel said table.  \n  3. In combination with a transfer-table, an air-motor supported thereby, means for supplying said motor with air under pressure, an auxiliary air-reservoir connected with said motor, a power-shaft, gearing whereby when said motor is in operation said table may be propelled, and mechanism for intermittingly connecting said gearing and motor.  \n  4. In combination with a transfer-table, a motor supported thereby, a shaft connected with said motor, a fixed rack, pinions meshing with said rack, gearing on the motor-shaft adapted to actuate aforesaid pinions and means for shifting the gearing on the shaft and thereby control the direction of rotation of said table, substantially as and for the purposes set forth.  \n In testimony whereof I afiix my signature in\u0026#39; Witnesses:  \n JosErH WILHELM, CHAs.

Fig. 2 is an elevation, enlarged somewhat over Fig. 1, showing one end of the table and devices whereby when they are set in motion are adapted to shift the table to the right or the left. Fig. 3 illustrates in section and in detail the pivot-stand upon which said table rotates. Fig. 4 is a sectional detail in elevation, showing the manner of locking the table when it is desired to connect the rails of the table Serial No. 179,465. (No model.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith coadjacent rails on the surface of the grounda While I have illustrated in the accompanying drawings a rotating table, it is to be understood the power devices may be employed with equal facility on a table which is adapted to be reciprocated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the drawings, 1 indicates a table of the usual construction set in adepression2 of the ground, the opposite ends of the table provided with one or more wheels or rollers 3, journaled in bearings L and rolling upon the tramway or track 5, secured to the base or foundation 6. The pivot-stand of the table (indicated as 7 and provided with roller-bearings 8) is one of the many forms of pivotstands that may be employed in a complete device and supported in the bottom of the depression 2. The table is provided with the usual transverse ties 9, to which the longitudinal rails 10 are secured, extending from end to end of the table and adapted to coact with rails 11 on the surface of the ground, leading off in all directions from such table. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12 indicates a power-shaft extending longitudinally of the table 1 and may be supported at any point and in any suitablemanner; but I have shown the same journaled in boxings 13, supported by the ties 9, as shown, the center of the shaft passing through and operatively connected with working parts of an airmotor 14:, which may be of any suitable design and containing suflicient number of horsepower. On the opposite ends of the shaft 12 is carried a sleeve 15, feathered thereon, and secured to the sleeves are the bevel gears or frictionwheels 16 and 17, adapted to mesh with a gear 18, fixed to a'shaft 19, journaled in boxings 20, supported by'the table 1. It is adapted to shift the sleeve 15 for the purpose of interchanging the gears 16 18 and 17 18 for rotating and shifting the table in opposite directions. This is accomplished by means of the lever 21, having a pivotal connection at 22 with the table, and lower bifurcated ends 23 engaging the sleeve for the purpose of shifting the same., The lever extends up above the table a desirable distance, and combined with the usual pawl-and-rack connection for looking theposition of the sleeve 15 on the shaft 12 after shifting. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gearing by which the table is propelled consists of a pinion 2 1 on the shaft 19,whioh meshes with a rack 25, seated in the wall of the depression 2 of the ground and as shown in the drawings.

(ModeL) To all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, HENRY M. GUILD, a citizen of the United States, residing at Erie, in the county of Erie and State of Pennsylvania,  \n  haveinvented certain new and useful Improvements in Syringes, of which the following is a specification. I  \n  The purpose of this invention is to provide improvements in the type of syringes especially adapted for irrigating the rectum and flushing the colon or large intestine. This type of syringe involves a structure consisting of a reservoir for holding the fluid to be injected, a head carried by the said reservoir 5 and secured thereto, and an injection-stem mounted upon the said head. Personal weight upon the reservoir is the motive power which forces the fluid into the colon without physical effort on the part of the user.  \n  The invention per se relates particularly to the means for regulating the quantity of fluid passing through the injection -stem; and it consists in a peculiar form of valve disposed upon the head.  \n  5 For a full description of the invention and the merits thereof and also to acquire a knowledge of the details of construction of the means for effecting the result reference is to be had to the following description and drawings hereto attached.  \n  iVhile the essential and characteristic features of the invention are susceptible of modification, still the preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which- Figure l is a perspective view showing the embodiment of the invention. Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional view through the head and adjacent the operating parts. Fig. 3 is a detail perspective view of the valve-operating stem. I  \n  Corresponding and like parts are referred to in the following description and indicated in all the views of the drawings by the same reference characters.  \n As hereinbefore premised, the invention comprises a reservoir 1, which consists of a rubber bag or analogous receptacle in itspreferred form, a head 2, secured to the reservoir 1, an injection-stem 3, mounted upon the head, and a valve 4, also suitably disposed upon the head and adapted for regulation of the quantity of liquid passing through the injection-stem 3.  \n  The head 2 is of approximately conoidal 5 5 shape and is secured to the reservoir by means ofa plate 5. The injection-stem 3 is also threaded to the head at the upper portion thereof and is held in its proper position in the rectum by the natural restriction of the sphincter muscle. The valve 4 is provided with the valve-stem 6, having a knob 7 for manipulation of the valve. The valve is designed to be permanently attached to the head 2 and is provided with a reduced threaded 6 5 end 8, and the valve is disposed in a trans verse opening 9 upon the head 2. The valvestem 6 is preferably integral with the valve 4, the two therefore\u0026#39;constituting a single struc tural element. To hold the valve 4 from dis- 7o placement from the head 2, the same is provided with an arcuate recess 10, and a stop 11 is threaded into the vertical opening 12 upon the head 2 and adapted to interlock with the arcuate recess 10 to prevent the aforesaid v displacement of the valve 4. The stop 11 may be a screw or corresponding fastening device and besides preventing longitudinal displacement of the valve from the transverse opening 9 serves to limitthe rotary movement of the valve. The limit of rotary movement of the valve in one direction disposes the valve with the valve-opening 13 in registry with the duct 14, through which the fluid passes to the injection-stem 8.  \n  The peculiar form of stop 11 employed is advantageous in that the same is located so as to be housed, this being of importance for many obvious reasons. The stop also is disposed so as to form a twofold office-namely, as 9 means for limiting the rotary movement of the valve and for preventing longitudinal displacement thereof, thus obviating the provision of an auxiliary or independent element for accomplishing either of the above.  \n  When turning the stem 6 to throw the opening of the valve 4 out of registry with the opening of the head 2, said valve receives a twofold movementone rotary, the other longitudinal-by reason of its screw-thread connection with the head. This combined movement of the valve causes a wall of the groove 10 to ride upon a side of the stop 11, and the resultant wedging or cam action compels a crowding of the matching screw-threads (If the parts 8 and 9, so as to prevent any possi ble leakage between the valve and head when the said valve is closed and the reservoir is subjected to pressure. c  \n  Having thus described the invention, What is claimed as new is- 1. In combination, a head provided with an injection-tube and an opening in communication with said tube, a rotary valve mounted in the said head and extended across the aforesaid opening thereof and having an opening to register therewith in one position of the valve, matching screw-threads between the valve and head to effect a simultaneous longitudinal movement of the valve with its rotary movement, and an interlocking groove and stop between the head and valve to limit the combined rotary and longitudinal movement thereof and to effect a crowding or closing of the screw-threads of the valve and head by a cam or wedging action, substantially as described.  \n  2. In a syringe, the combination of a conoiolal shaped head having a longitudinal valve-opening and a transverse opening extended into the head from one side and intersecting the valve-opening, the inner end portion of the transverse opening being closed, threaded-and contracted, a valve having its inner end reduced and threaded to match the reduced threaded portion of the said transverse opening and provided with an opening to register with the aforesaid valve-opening, and having the enlarged portion adjacent to the threaded part provided with a circumferential groove, and a stop titted into an opening of the head and extended into the said circumferential groove to act with a wall thereof by a cam or wedging action upon turning the valve to limit its combined rotary and longitudinal movement and effect a closing or crowding of the matching screw-threads between the valve and head, substantially as set forth.  \n  In testimony whereof I affix my signature in presence of, two Witnesses.  \n HENRY M.

Fig. 3 is a horizontal section looking upward, which section is taken practically on the line 3 3 of Fig. 2; and Fig. 4 is an end view of the device, the music-carrying arms being shown in transversesection.  \n  The body A of the device is in the form of a box-casing comprising a back member 10, an upper longitudinal forwardly-extending member 11, the ends 11 whereof preferably extend beyond the ends of the body proper, and a bottom longitudinal member 12, the  \n terminal portions 12 whereof are shown as being bent downward and outward to form legs, and these legs may be covered with felt or other soft material, if desired. The\u0026#39;body of the casing is substantially completed in I construction by the addition of a front coverplate 14, (shown in Figs. 1 and 4,) and it may be here remarked that the ends of the body may be closed by suitable plates (0, as shown in Fig. 4, or the end portions of the said body may be left open.  \n  At the front upper and lower central portion of the body A forwardly-extending horizontally disposed segmental lugs 13 are formed, and the front plate 14 is provided with a central correspondingly segmentally formed section 15, and in this segmental section of the said front plate 14 slots 16 are made extending longitudinally of the plate. These slots may be in any desired number, but they should correspond in number to the number of leaf-turning arms E employed. Longitudinal grooves or depressions 17 are made in the outer face of the front plate 14, extending one from the left-hand end of each slot 16 to the left-hand terminal of the said plate, and corresponding slots 17 m are made atthe right-hand portion of the said front plate 14, and at one side edge of the latter i slots 17 recesses 18 are produced, a recess 18 being\u0026#34; provided for. each slot 17\u0026#39;. A. pivot pin 19 is made to extend through the lugs 13 of the body A, the said pivot-pin being fixed to the said lugs. v  \n Near the left-hand end of the body A a keeper-plate 20 is secured to the inner face the right-hand end of the body, as is shown best in Fig. 3.  \n  Adjacent to the keeper-plate 20 a releasingplate B is located on the inner face of the back member 10 of the body. This releasing-plate B is arched or curved at its left-hand end, and the left-hand end portion of the said plate has direct bearing on the inner face of the back member 10 of the body, as is also best shown in Fig. 3. The left-hand end of the body portion 23 of this releasing-plate B is flat and substantially rectangular, being provided with a transverse slot 24:, as is shown in both Figs. 2 and 3. here the curved section 22 of the said releasing-plate B connects with the body or flat section 23 a trough 25 is produced in the forward face of the said releasingrplate, the trough being rectangular or polygonal in cross-section. The polygonal or rectangular section 26 of an angular triparm C is made to fit in the trough 25, as is shown also in Fig. 3, which angular trip-arm C comprises a vertical member 0 and a horizontal member a. The vertical member 0 of the trip-arm O is pivoted in the top and bottom portions of the body A of the device in a manner which will enable the said member c to turn, the polygonal portion 26 of the trip-arm being between the upper and lower pivots of the said section 0. The lower or horizontal section 0 of the trip-arm extends forwardly beyond the forward edge of the body A at a desired point below its bottom portion and beneath an angular bracket D, which extends from the central bottom portion of the said body A at the front.  \n  WVhen a music-turning arm E is to be released from its locking device, to be hereinafter described, and automatically carried, by means also to be hereinafter described, from the right-hand portion ofthe body to the lefthand portion of the body, the locking device is released through the medium of the out- Ward movement of the flat or body portion 23 of the releasing-plate, and when the plate is moved to accomplish such a result the slotted end of the plate moves forwardly from the back of the body and the curved portion 22 of the said releasing-plate is forcibly pressed against the back member 10 of the body, and so acts as a spring to return the plate to its normal position when relieved from tension. This movement of the releasing-plate B is brought about by turning the aforesaid angular trip-arm C, and such movement is accomplished by means of a shifting device consisting of a fingerpiece D, having sliding movement in the bracket D, which fingerpiece within the bracket is pivoted to one extremity of an elbow-lever 27, fulcrumed in the bracket D, as is shown in Fig. l, the terminal of the other member of the said elbowlever 27 being preferably curved, so as to have a bearing against a side of the lower or horizontal member 0 of the aforesaid triparm G. Therefore by quickly pulling down the finger-piece D the trip-arm C is rocked and the releasing-plate B is given the movement just above mentioned. It may be here remarked that the body is shown as braced at a point back of the plate 14 by means of a crossbar 22, and any desired number of such may be employed. 7  \n  I have illustrated four sheet or leaf turning arms E in position in. the body. These arms extend longitudinally of the body and are preferably graduated as to length, the grad uation being such that the upper arm is the shortest and the lower arm is the longest. Each sheet or leaf turning arm is attached to a drum 0, and these drums, as is best shown in Fig. 2, are mounted to turn on the pivotpin 19. A spring 28 is coiled around each drum,one end of each springbeing secured to a drum, and the opposite ends of the said prings are secured to the arched portion 21 of the keeper-plate 20, as is illustrated at 29 in Figs. 2 and 3, and the drums are preferably grooved to receive the springs, in consequence of which construction only a portion of a spring appears in Fig. 3. These springs have a tendency to draw the sheet or leaf turning arms E over to the lefthand side portion of the body, and these springs are placed under tension when the sheet or leaf turning arms are at the right-hand portion of the body A, and conse\u0026#39;q uently locking devices are needed to hold the said sheet or leaf turning arms E in their latter position. Each sheet or leaf turning arm E is provided with a hook-shaped keeper 30, which extends rearward from what is the rear edge of an arm E when the arm is over at the right of the body, as is illustrated in Fig. 3. 1n connection with each keeper 30 a latch-lever is employed. These latch-levers, reading from the top downward, are designated, respectively, as 31, 32, 33, and 34% and are suitably piv- IIC oted on the back of the body near the lefta hand end thereof, as is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Each latch-lever is provided with a suitable head 35, adapted to engage with a keeper 30 on a leaf or sheet turning arm E. The upper latch-lever 31 is shorter than the others, all of the others being of the same length, and the inner end of this upper or shorter latch-lever 31 rests normally upon the front face of the releasing-plate B at a point above and to the right of the slot 24: in the said plate, whereas the inner ends of all of the other latch-levers extend normally over the aforesaid slot 24 in the releasing-plate B. The inner ends of the latchlevers are normally pressed rearward by means in Figs. 2 and 3, the said tongues usually extending from a bar 37 on which the latch-levers are pivoted.  \n of the lowermost drum, and these lifting-arms extend from the drums in direction of the right-hand end of the body A, having their left-hand ends outwardly curved and eccentrically and pivotally mounted on the drums by suitable pins 39, as is shown in Fig. 3.  \n  At the front or right-hand end of each lifting-arm 38 a shoe \u0026amp; is formed, apertured for the free passage of the longer or left-hand end of a latch-levernamely, the latch-levers 32, 33, and 3tas is shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and when the sheet or leaf turning arms E are carried to the right and are held by the heads of the latch-levers all the shoes 40 of the liftingarms 38 willbe over the slot 2\u0026amp; in the releasing-plate B, as is shown in Fig. 2. Each sheet or leaf turning arm E at its free end has pivotally attached to it a finger 41, and these fingers are adapted to be placed between the leaves or sheets of music to be turned, and at the upper portion of the body A a frame 42,  \n  usually in the form of a lyre, is secured in any suitable manner, upon which the music has bearing between its upper and lower edges; but the lower edge of the music will rest upon the upper member 11 of the body A, having the end extensions 11. The said body Alias bearing upon the music-supporting ledge of a piano, organ, or a music-stand, for example.  \n  In operation after the device has been set, as is shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and after the music on the first leaf or sheet has been played the finger-piece D is drawn down by a quick movement of the hand, whereupon the slotted end of the releasing-plate B is carried outward, and consequently the upper latch-lever 31, which action releases the upper sheetturning arm E, whereupon its spring 28 acts to carry the arm over to the left and turn the sheet with which the finger 41 of the arm engages. When the upper sheet-turning arm is in position at the left of the body, the shoe of the uppermost lifting-arm 38 will have been carried over the releasing-plate at its right-hand end, while the shoes of the other arms will remain stationary over the slot 2 1 in the said releasing-plate. Therefore when the finger-piece D of the shifting device is again drawn down the shoe upon the liftingarm 38, connected with the latch-lever 32, will be carried outward by the right-hand end portion of the releasing-plate B and will release the latch-lever 32 from engagement with the second upper sheet-turning arm, whose spring 28 will then act to throw said arm to the left, and as the said arm so turns it will place the shoe 40 of the next lifting-arm 38 in position A lifting-arm 38 is con- 1 -nected with each drum 0, with the exception \u0026#39;to lift the third turning-arm E when the finger-piece D is next operated, and so on.  \n Having thus described my invention, I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent 1. In music-leaf turners, pivoted, spring- Econtrolled sheet turning arms, spring controlled latch-levers for the turning-arms, a release device for the latch-levers, an operating mechanism for the releasing device, and arms for establishing operative relation between the releasing device and the latch-levers, said arms being placed in position by the throw of the turning-arms.  \n  2.

These slots may be in any desired number, but they should correspond in number to the number of leaf-turning arms E employed. Longitudinal grooves or depressions 17 are made in the outer face of the front plate 14, extending one from the left-hand end of each slot 16 to the left-hand terminal of the said plate, and corresponding slots 17 m are made atthe right-hand portion of the said front plate 14, and at one side edge of the latter i slots 17 recesses 18 are produced, a recess 18 being\" provided for. each slot 17'.

This releasing-plate B is arched or curved at its left-hand end, and the left-hand end portion of the said plate has direct bearing on the inner face of the back member 10 of the body, as is also best shown in Fig. 3. The left-hand end of the body portion 23 of this releasing-plate B is flat and substantially rectangular, being provided with a transverse slot 24:, as is shown in both Figs. 2 and 3. here the curved section 22 of the said releasing-plate B connects with the body or flat section 23 a trough 25 is produced in the forward face of the said releasingrplate, the trough being rectangular or polygonal in cross-section. The polygonal or rectangular section 26 of an angular triparm C is made to fit in the trough 25, as is shown also in Fig. 3, which angular trip-arm C comprises a vertical member 0 and a horizontal member a. The vertical member 0 of the trip-arm O is pivoted in the top and bottom portions of the body A of the device in a manner which will enable the said member c to turn, the polygonal portion 26 of the trip-arm being between the upper and lower pivots of the said section 0.

This movement of the releasing-plate B is brought about by turning the aforesaid angular trip-arm C, and such movement is accomplished by means of a shifting device consisting of a fingerpiece D, having sliding movement in the bracket D, which fingerpiece within the bracket is pivoted to one extremity of an elbow-lever 27, fulcrumed in the bracket D, as is shown in Fig. l, the terminal of the other member of the said elbowlever 27 being preferably curved, so as to have a bearing against a side of the lower or horizontal member 0 of the aforesaid triparm G. Therefore by quickly pulling down the finger-piece D the trip-arm C is rocked and the releasing-plate B is given the movement just above mentioned. It may be here remarked that the body is shown as braced at a point back of the plate 14 by means of a crossbar 22, and any desired number of such may be employed. 7 \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e I have illustrated four sheet or leaf turning arms E in position in. the body.

Each sheet or leaf turning arm is attached to a drum 0, and these drums, as is best shown in Fig. 2, are mounted to turn on the pivotpin 19. A spring 28 is coiled around each drum,one end of each springbeing secured to a drum, and the opposite ends of the said prings are secured to the arched portion 21 of the keeper-plate 20, as is illustrated at 29 in Figs. 2 and 3, and the drums are preferably grooved to receive the springs, in consequence of which construction only a portion of a spring appears in Fig. 3. These springs have a tendency to draw the sheet or leaf turning arms E over to the lefthand side portion of the body, and these springs are placed under tension when the sheet or leaf turning arms are at the right-hand portion of the body A, and conse'q uently locking devices are needed to hold the said sheet or leaf turning arms E in their latter position. Each sheet or leaf turning arm E is provided with a hook-shaped keeper 30, which extends rearward from what is the rear edge of an arm E when the arm is over at the right of the body, as is illustrated in Fig. 3. 1n connection with each keeper 30 a latch-lever is employed. These latch-levers, reading from the top downward, are designated, respectively, as 31, 32, 33, and 34% and are suitably piv- IIC oted on the back of the body near the lefta hand end thereof, as is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Each latch-lever is provided with a suitable head 35, adapted to engage with a keeper 30 on a leaf or sheet turning arm E. The upper latch-lever 31 is shorter than the others, all of the others being of the same length, and the inner end of this upper or shorter latch-lever 31 rests normally upon the front face of the releasing-plate B at a point above and to the right of the slot 24: in the said plate, whereas the inner ends of all of the other latch-levers extend normally over the aforesaid slot 24 in the releasing-plate B. The inner ends of the latchlevers are normally pressed rearward by means in Figs. 2 and 3, the said tongues usually extending from a bar 37 on which the latch-levers are pivoted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the lowermost drum, and these lifting-arms extend from the drums in direction of the right-hand end of the body A, having their left-hand ends outwardly curved and eccentrically and pivotally mounted on the drums by suitable pins 39, as is shown in Fig. 3. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e At the front or right-hand end of each lifting-arm 38 a shoe \u0026amp; is formed, apertured for the free passage of the longer or left-hand end of a latch-levernamely, the latch-levers 32, 33, and 3tas is shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and when the sheet or leaf turning arms E are carried to the right and are held by the heads of the latch-levers all the shoes 40 of the liftingarms 38 willbe over the slot 2\u0026amp; in the releasing-plate B, as is shown in Fig. 2. Each sheet or leaf turning arm E at its free end has pivotally attached to it a finger 41, and these fingers are adapted to be placed between the leaves or sheets of music to be turned, and at the upper portion of the body A a frame 42, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e usually in the form of a lyre, is secured in any suitable manner, upon which the music has bearing between its upper and lower edges; but the lower edge of the music will rest upon the upper member 11 of the body A, having the end extensions 11. The said body Alias bearing upon the music-supporting ledge of a piano, organ, or a music-stand, for example. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In operation after the device has been set, as is shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and after the music on the first leaf or sheet has been played the finger-piece D is drawn down by a quick movement of the hand, whereupon the slotted end of the releasing-plate B is carried outward, and consequently the upper latch-lever 31, which action releases the upper sheetturning arm E, whereupon its spring 28 acts to carry the arm over to the left and turn the sheet with which the finger 41 of the arm engages. When the upper sheet-turning arm is in position at the left of the body, the shoe of the uppermost lifting-arm 38 will have been carried over the releasing-plate at its right-hand end, while the shoes of the other arms will remain stationary over the slot 2 1 in the said releasing-plate. Therefore when the finger-piece D of the shifting device is again drawn down the shoe upon the liftingarm 38, connected with the latch-lever 32, will be carried outward by the right-hand end portion of the releasing-plate B and will release the latch-lever 32 from engagement with the second upper sheet-turning arm, whose spring 28 will then act to throw said arm to the left, and as the said arm so turns it will place the shoe 40 of the next lifting-arm 38 in position A lifting-arm 38 is con- 1 -nected with each drum 0, with the exception 'to lift the third turning-arm E when the finger-piece D is next operated, and so on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving thus described my invention, I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent 1.

Serial No. 115,5\u0026#39;76. (N0 model.)  \n To atZZ whom it may concern: 7  \n  Be it known that I, THEODORE CLAUsING, a citizen of the United States, residing at New Knoxville, in the county of Auglaize, State of Ohio, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in W ind-Chests for Pipe- Organs; and I do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.  \n  This invention relates to wind-chests for pipe-organs; and it has for its object to provide a construction which will be cheap and simple while the parts will not become loose and there will not be a leakage of wind.  \n  A further object of the invention is to provide a construction wherein the noise of operation will be reduced to a minimum.  \n  Other objects and advantages of the invention will be understood from the following description.  \n In the drawings forming a portion of this specification, and in which like numerals of.  \n reference indicate similar parts in the several views, Figure 1 is a vertical section through a wind-chest embodying the present invention Fig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. 1 and showing the valves open. Fig. 3 is a longitudinal section through a Wind-chest, illustrating a modification with the valve closed. Fig. 4: is a view similar to Fig. 3 and showing the valve open. Fig. 5 is a top plan view of the construction shown in Fig. 1.  \n  Referring now to the drawings there is shown a wind-chest 5, from the upper side of which lead the pipes 6, which communicate with the openings 7 which latter are opened and closed by means of the slide 8, which is actuated from a corresponding stop of the organ.  \n  The openings 7 are arranged in series transversely of the wind-chest, and beneath each series of openings is secured a cross-piece 9, which depends at an acute angle to the under face of the top of the wind-chest and extends continuously from one side of the wind-chest to the other, the top and sides of the windchest being secured to this cross-piece rigidly, so that displacement of the parts is prevented. The slanting arrangement of each of the cross-pieces 9 results in what may be termed an upper face 10 and a lower .face 11, and in said upper face is formed an opening 12, corresponding to each -of the openings 7 and in the same vertical plane therewith. The openings 7 and 12 are connected by windpassages 13, so that wind may pass from the chest into and through the pipes when the openings 12 are uncovered.  \n  Valves in the form of blocks 14 are hinged to the upper faces of the cross-pieces 9 and depend from their hinges so as to normally lie against the upper faces of the cross-pieces and cover the openings 12 therein to prevent passage of wind from the chest.  \n  In the present instance there are shown two cross-pieces 9 and two corresponding series of openings 7, and to actuate the valves of both cross-pieces simultaneously pivoted hangers 15 are suspended from the top of the windchest, and pivoted to the lower endsof these hangers is the push-bar 16, to which are connected push-rods 17 passed through guide openings or perforations 18 in the cross-pieces, so that when the push-rods are moved in one direction they will engage and lift the corresponding valves from their closed positions, the push-bars 16 having rods or wires 19 attached thereto and passed through openings 21 in the .side of the Wind-chest, where they are connected with the key actions of the organ. Springs 22 are arranged with one end against the inner face of the wind-chest and their opposite ends against the adjacent ends of the push-bars to return the latter to their normal positions when they are released. In the paths of return movement of the push-bars are the padded ends 23 of leaf-springs 24, which are secured to the inner face of the adjacent side of the wind-chest.  \n Referring now to Figs. 3 and 4 of the drawings, in this form of the invention the arrange-- ment of the valves is the same as that above described; but the push-bars are supplanted by bars 30, which are pressed inwardly by the attached rods 31, when the valves are to be opened,it being understood that while a single valve only is shown in the modification the arrangement may include a greater number.  \n  It will be seen that with the constructions illustrated the openings at each side of each valve are not present, and it will be understood that the action can be put in front of the wind-chest or at the rear of it,as preferred.  \n  It will be understood that in practice other modifications of the invention may be made and that any suitable materials and propertions may be used for the various parts without departing from the spirit of the invention.  \n lVhat is claimed is A wind-chest for organs havingopenings in its top and having transverse pieces attached to and depending from the top of the chest at an acute angle thereto, each of said transverse pieces having an opening at its side adjacent to the top of the chest and a passage leading from the inner end of such opening upwardly through the transverse piece and registering with an opening in the top of the chest for the escape of wind, a valve hinged to each transverse piece above the opening and adapted to rest normally over the opening, said transverse piece having perforations therethrough below the air-passage, a push-rod slidahly engaged with the perforation of each cross-piece and disposed to engage and raise the valve, pivoted hangers depending from the top of the chest, cross-rods connected to the ends of the hangers and having the push-rods connected thereto, and springdates secured at one end to an end of the chest and having pads secured to their free ends, said free ends lying in the paths of movement of the cross-rods and adapted for engagement by the ends thereof.  \n  In testimony whereof I aflix my signature in presence of two witnesses,  \n  THEODORE CLAUSlNG.

Fig. 5 is a top plan view of the construction shown in Fig. 1. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring now to the drawings there is shown a wind-chest 5, from the upper side of which lead the pipes 6, which communicate with the openings 7 which latter are opened and closed by means of the slide 8, which is actuated from a corresponding stop of the organ. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The openings 7 are arranged in series transversely of the wind-chest, and beneath each series of openings is secured a cross-piece 9, which depends at an acute angle to the under face of the top of the wind-chest and extends continuously from one side of the wind-chest to the other, the top and sides of the windchest being secured to this cross-piece rigidly, so that displacement of the parts is prevented. The slanting arrangement of each of the cross-pieces 9 results in what may be termed an upper face 10 and a lower .face 11, and in said upper face is formed an opening 12, corresponding to each -of the openings 7 and in the same vertical plane therewith. The openings 7 and 12 are connected by windpassages 13, so that wind may pass from the chest into and through the pipes when the openings 12 are uncovered. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Valves in the form of blocks 14 are hinged to the upper faces of the cross-pieces 9 and depend from their hinges so as to normally lie against the upper faces of the cross-pieces and cover the openings 12 therein to prevent passage of wind from the chest. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the present instance there are shown two cross-pieces 9 and two corresponding series of openings 7, and to actuate the valves of both cross-pieces simultaneously pivoted hangers 15 are suspended from the top of the windchest, and pivoted to the lower endsof these hangers is the push-bar 16, to which are connected push-rods 17 passed through guide openings or perforations 18 in the cross-pieces, so that when the push-rods are moved in one direction they will engage and lift the corresponding valves from their closed positions, the push-bars 16 having rods or wires 19 attached thereto and passed through openings 21 in the .side of the Wind-chest, where they are connected with the key actions of the organ. Springs 22 are arranged with one end against the inner face of the wind-chest and their opposite ends against the adjacent ends of the push-bars to return the latter to their normal positions when they are released. In the paths of return movement of the push-bars are the padded ends 23 of leaf-springs 24, which are secured to the inner face of the adjacent side of the wind-chest. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferring now to Figs. 3 and 4 of the drawings, in this form of the invention the arrange-- ment of the valves is the same as that above described; but the push-bars are supplanted by bars 30, which are pressed inwardly by the attached rods 31, when the valves are to be opened,it being understood that while a single valve only is shown in the modification the arrangement may include a greater number. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be seen that with the constructions illustrated the openings at each side of each valve are not present, and it will be understood that the action can be put in front of the wind-chest or at the rear of it,as preferred. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be understood that in practice other modifications of the invention may be made and that any suitable materials and propertions may be used for the various parts without departing from the spirit of the invention. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elVhat is claimed is A wind-chest for organs havingopenings in its top and having transverse pieces attached to and depending from the top of the chest at an acute angle thereto, each of said transverse pieces having an opening at its side adjacent to the top of the chest and a passage leading from the inner end of such opening upwardly through the transverse piece and registering with an opening in the top of the chest for the escape of wind, a valve hinged to each transverse piece above the opening and adapted to rest normally over the opening, said transverse piece having perforations therethrough below the air-passage, a push-rod slidahly engaged with the perforation of each cross-piece and disposed to engage and raise the valve, pivoted hangers depending from the top of the chest, cross-rods connected to the ends of the hangers and having the push-rods connected thereto, and springdates secured at one end to an end of the chest and having pads secured to their free ends, said free ends lying in the paths of movement of the cross-rods and adapted for engagement by the ends thereof. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In testimony whereof I aflix my signature in presence of two witnesses, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e THEODORE CLAUSlNG.

(No model.)  \n To all whom it may concern: I  \n  Be it known that I, FRANK H. PARADICE, a citizen of the United States, residing at Denver, in the county of Denver and State of Colorado, have invented a new and useful Hose Connection, of which the following is aspecification.  \n  My invention relates to hose connections or menders used to connect two sections of hose together, generally to connect hose that has had a defective piece-cut out, but is also useful to join two or more sections of unused hose.  \n Hose-menders have been heretofore made of an inner tube of metal or wood, the hose fastened thereto by bands of wire or rings of metal clamped on in different ways. Among the defects of these styles of repair-couplings are insufficient grip or tenacity, excepting when fastened by use of special tools not generally available at dwellings, where gardenhose is chiefly used, the catching (whether of wire or those fastened with screws) on sidewalks or other obstacles, due to the uneven or unsuitable exterior form of the clamps. These objections have been overcome to some extent by a hose-mender made of metal, whereby the hose is clenched onto the inner tube of mender by hammering down the slotted edges of the outer tube. My invention has particular reference to the last-mentioned form of mender and is an improvement of same. This form of mender as heretofore made has an inner tube, usually with a straight bore. The outside of the ends of the inner tube which receive the hose are tapering in form, being larger in diameter towardthe center of mender, and the slotted outer edges are either parallel with the inside of the inner tube or they are slightly depressed or tapering (2 a, decreasing the diameter) from the center of tube toward the ends of mender. Now it is found that the hose has a tendency to slip off spigot end of mender when the slotted ends are being hammered down, and it is difiicult to hold the hose in place on a flat surface while clenching the mender. My invention overcomes these objections, and by its use the mender can be hammered down while the hose and mender are lying in parallel line with floor, sidewalk, bench, or other object which is used to hammer the hose-mender down on; also, by its use one blow of the hammer, used withsits face parallel with the mender, will clench part of both sides of the mender. The  \n form of the inner tube is such that the hose or strap.  \n Figure 1 shows the hose-mender as it appears when fastened by hammering down the points or fingers. Fig. 2 is a cross-section of mender with fingers hammered down on one end of mender, and on the other end the fingers are shown as they are before theyare clenched. Fig. 3 is a view of mender before it is hammered down on hose, one end with hose on it and the other showing the spigot end of hose-mender. A hammer-head is shown above Fig. 3 and a slab of stone below. The face of hammer and top of stone are parallel, indicating the facility with which the mender may be fastened to the hose. Fig. 4 is a crosssection of mender at 2 2, Fig. 1. Like figures refer to like parts in the several views.  \n  6 represents the hose; 2, the fingers or points; 3, the the inner tube with spigot end; 7 the slots in outer shell of mender.  \n The manner in which this mender is attached is as follows: The end of the tube is forced into the hose, the spigot causing the hose to expand and as it passes the spigot to contract,  \n as shown at- Fig. 2. The other end is then forced into the other section of hose which is to be joined. Then the points of the mender are hammered down, as indicated at Fig. 3. When hammered down, the mender assumes the form as shown at Fig. 1.  \n Having described my invention and its use,  \n what I olaini as new, and for which I desire Letters Patent, is  \n  A hose-joiner complete in one article consisting of an inner tube with enlarged spigot ends for insertion into hose to be joined, and  \n an outer portion or shell which will surround the hose to be joined; the edges of said portion forming circles which are greater in diameter than any other part of the joiner and set at an angle relative to the longitudinal side of the i5 inner tube of from one to ninety degrees and being slotted, substantially as set forth.  \n  In testimony whereof I aflix my signature in presence of two witnesses.  \n FRANK H.

Serial modem To all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that LVVILLIAM SOBEY,a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Racine, in the county of Racine, State of Wisconsin, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Wheel-Hubs for Agricultural Implements, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.  \n  This invention has for its object, primarily, to provide improved means for attaching the wheels of agricultural implements to their axles in such manner that the lubrication of the axles may be effectively secured and the access of dust to the bearings of the axles may be guarded against.  \n  The invention consists in the features of improvement hereinafter described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings, and particularly pointed out in the claims at the end of this specification.  \n  Figure 1 is a view in elevation of the hubsleeve with connected parts. Fig. 2 is a View in vertical longitudinal section of the parts illustrated in Fig. 1 and with a portion of the wheel in position thereon. Fig. 3 is a detail plan view of one of the clamp-boxes. Fig. A is a detail end view of the interlocked sections of the clamp-box.  \n  A designates the axle, and B denotes the hub-sleeve mounted thereon. The hub-sleeve B is of such diameter as to snugly receive the axle while at the same time allowing the hub to revolve thereon. The inner end of the hubsleeve B is provided with a peripheral flange 5, over which set the sections O and O ofthe clamp-box, whereby the hub-sleeve is retained in position upon the axle. The sections O and O of this clamp-box are formed at each side with interlocking tongues, and grooves c and c and the sections O and O are formed with flanges c and 0, through which pass the bolts D, whereby the sections O and O are held securely together and in position upon the axle A. As shown, the bolts D are formed with heads (Z and are provided with retaining-nuts d. One of the sections of the clamp-box is provided with a lug c, that sets within a recess a, formed in the periphery of the axle A, so that when the sections of the clamp-box are in position for use, as shown in the drawings, 5 they will be rigidly secured to the axle, so that they can neither revolve thereon nor move lengthwise thereof. The chambered sections (land O of the clamp-box set over the peripheral flanged of the hub-sleeve loosely enough to permit a free revolution of the sleeve upon the axle and yet guard the hub-sleeve against movement :in longitudinal direction. As shown, the upper section O of the clamp-box is provided with a perforation 0 whereby lu- 6 bricating material may be admitted to the in terior of the clamp-box.  \n  The outer end of the hub-sleeve B is screwthreaded, as at If, and over this externallyscrew-threaded end of the sleeve B sets the vertically-threaded cap D This cap I) performs the function of retaining the annular spoke-socket E upon the hub -sleeve B, and being chambered, as shown, it serves also as a receptacle for grease that will be forced into 76 the slight space between the axle A and the hub-sleeve B when the cap I) is screwed in position for use, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings. The cap I) is formed, preferably, with a squared portion d adapted to receive a wrench, whereby the cap may be set in position upon the sleeve B of the hub. The hub-sleeve B is provided adjacent its inner end with a peripheral flange or abutment 7),.against which will hear the inner end of 80 the annular spoke-socket E, this socket E being provided with large holes to receive the inner ends of the spokes E. As shown, the periphery of the hub-sleeve B is formed with an annular recess 0\u0026#39; at that portion of the 8 5 periphery of the hub-sleeve opposite the ends of the spokes E. i  \n  It will be observed that the spoke-socket E is rigidly held in position upon the sleeve B between the flange or abutment 6* and the end of the cap I) and out of contact with the hubretaining clamp.  \n  When the parts are set in position for use, as shown in Fig. 2 of the drawings, the hubsleeve B will be held securely upon the axle A by means of the sections O and O of the clamp-box. The annular spoke-soeketE will be securely retained upon the hub-sleeve B between the peripheral flange 6* and the inner end of the cap D As the cap D is screwed to the position seen in Fig. 2, its chamber having first been filled with grease, the grease will be forced into the slight space between the surface of the axle A and of the hubsleeve B. The grease remaining within the chamber of the cap D will serve to insure the lubrication of the axle for a long period and will prevent the access of dirt or dust to the outer end of the sleeve. The clamp-box at the inner end of the hub-sleeve not only serves to retain the hub in position, but serves also to prevent access of dust to the bearing-surface of the axle, and, furthermore, serves as a chamber to receive and retain the lubricant that may escape from the inner end of the hub-sleeve B or that may be admitted to the clamp-box through the perforation 0 Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n \u0026#39; 1. Thecombination Withthehub-sleevehaving an exteriorly-threaded portion at its outer end, of an interiorly-threaded, chambered cap engaging the outer threaded portion of said sleeve, an abutment fixed on said sleeve, an annular spoke-socket rigidly held in place upon said sleeve between said abutment and the inner end of said cap, a peripheral flange on the inner end of said hub-sleeve and means engaging said flange for rotatably securing the hub upon the axle.  \n  2. The combination with the hub-sleeve having an exteriorly-threaded portion at its outer end, of an interiorly threaded, chambered cap engaging the outer end of said sleeve, an annular flange on said sleeve, an annular spoke-socket rigidly held in place upon said sleeve between said flange and the inner end of said cap, a second annular flange on the inner end of said sleeve, and a clamp engaging said second flange for rotatably securing the hub upon the axle.  \n  3. The combination of the hub-sleeve B having a threaded portion 6 at its outer end and the annular flanges band 6 at its inner end, the \u0026#39;interiorly threaded chambered cap D engaging the outer threaded portion 5 and having the squared portion (Z upon its outer end, the annular spoke-socket E rigidly held in place between the flange b and the inner end of the cap B and\u0026#39;the clamp-box C engaging the flange b for rotatably securing the hub upon the axle.  \n \u0026#39; WILLIAM SOBEY.  \n Witnesses:  \n GEORGE HENRY BOLTON, LAWRENCE ScHIBSBY.","language":"en","truncated":false}],"description_localized_html":[{"text":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. 759,564.

Serial modem To all whom it may concern: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Be it known that LVVILLIAM SOBEY,a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Racine, in the county of Racine, State of Wisconsin, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Wheel-Hubs for Agricultural Implements, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention has for its object, primarily, to provide improved means for attaching the wheels of agricultural implements to their axles in such manner that the lubrication of the axles may be effectively secured and the access of dust to the bearings of the axles may be guarded against. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The invention consists in the features of improvement hereinafter described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings, and particularly pointed out in the claims at the end of this specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Figure 1 is a view in elevation of the hubsleeve with connected parts. Fig. 2 is a View in vertical longitudinal section of the parts illustrated in Fig. 1 and with a portion of the wheel in position thereon. Fig. 3 is a detail plan view of one of the clamp-boxes. Fig. A is a detail end view of the interlocked sections of the clamp-box. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A designates the axle, and B denotes the hub-sleeve mounted thereon. The hub-sleeve B is of such diameter as to snugly receive the axle while at the same time allowing the hub to revolve thereon. The inner end of the hubsleeve B is provided with a peripheral flange 5, over which set the sections O and O ofthe clamp-box, whereby the hub-sleeve is retained in position upon the axle. The sections O and O of this clamp-box are formed at each side with interlocking tongues, and grooves c and c and the sections O and O are formed with flanges c and 0, through which pass the bolts D, whereby the sections O and O are held securely together and in position upon the axle A. As shown, the bolts D are formed with heads (Z and are provided with retaining-nuts d. One of the sections of the clamp-box is provided with a lug c, that sets within a recess a, formed in the periphery of the axle A, so that when the sections of the clamp-box are in position for use, as shown in the drawings, 5 they will be rigidly secured to the axle, so that they can neither revolve thereon nor move lengthwise thereof. The chambered sections (land O of the clamp-box set over the peripheral flanged of the hub-sleeve loosely enough to permit a free revolution of the sleeve upon the axle and yet guard the hub-sleeve against movement :in longitudinal direction. As shown, the upper section O of the clamp-box is provided with a perforation 0 whereby lu- 6 bricating material may be admitted to the in terior of the clamp-box. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The outer end of the hub-sleeve B is screwthreaded, as at If, and over this externallyscrew-threaded end of the sleeve B sets the vertically-threaded cap D This cap I) performs the function of retaining the annular spoke-socket E upon the hub -sleeve B, and being chambered, as shown, it serves also as a receptacle for grease that will be forced into 76 the slight space between the axle A and the hub-sleeve B when the cap I) is screwed in position for use, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings. The cap I) is formed, preferably, with a squared portion d adapted to receive a wrench, whereby the cap may be set in position upon the sleeve B of the hub. The hub-sleeve B is provided adjacent its inner end with a peripheral flange or abutment 7),.against which will hear the inner end of 80 the annular spoke-socket E, this socket E being provided with large holes to receive the inner ends of the spokes E. As shown, the periphery of the hub-sleeve B is formed with an annular recess 0' at that portion of the 8 5 periphery of the hub-sleeve opposite the ends of the spokes E. i \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be observed that the spoke-socket E is rigidly held in position upon the sleeve B between the flange or abutment 6* and the end of the cap I) and out of contact with the hubretaining clamp. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e When the parts are set in position for use, as shown in Fig. 2 of the drawings, the hubsleeve B will be held securely upon the axle A by means of the sections O and O of the clamp-box. The annular spoke-soeketE will be securely retained upon the hub-sleeve B between the peripheral flange 6* and the inner end of the cap D As the cap D is screwed to the position seen in Fig. 2, its chamber having first been filled with grease, the grease will be forced into the slight space between the surface of the axle A and of the hubsleeve B. The grease remaining within the chamber of the cap D will serve to insure the lubrication of the axle for a long period and will prevent the access of dirt or dust to the outer end of the sleeve. The clamp-box at the inner end of the hub-sleeve not only serves to retain the hub in position, but serves also to prevent access of dust to the bearing-surface of the axle, and, furthermore, serves as a chamber to receive and retain the lubricant that may escape from the inner end of the hub-sleeve B or that may be admitted to the clamp-box through the perforation 0 Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e' 1.

CLARK, OF NEW YORK, N. Y., ASSIGNOR OF ONE-HALF TO EDWARD BALTZLEY, OF GLEN ECHO, MARYLAND.  \n REDUCTION OF COPPER ORES.  \n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 759,670, dated May 10, 1904.  \n Application filedSeptamber 10, 1902. Serial No. 122,785. (No specimens.)  \n To all whom, it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, ERNEST P. CLARK, a citizen of the United States, residing at the city of New York, in the borough of Manhattan and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in the Reduction of Copper Ores, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.  \n  This invention relates to a method of and means for extracting copper from low-grade ores of the varieties carrying copper in the form of carbonates, oxids, sulfids, and finelydivided metallic copper, and especially to certain methods and means for securing the copper contents at the lowest possible cost. In  \n working with ores of this class it is found that the carbonates, oxids, and metallic copper are readily soluble in the solution generally employed, but that the sullids are not soluble without previously oxidizing, which is generally accomplished by roasting the ores,  \n and in all mixed ores of this character when ever it has been attempted to obtain their values by such processes as herein contemplated the first proceeding has almost invariably been to roast the entire body of ore for the purpose of oxidizing that portion of the copper existing as sulfids. This entails alarge and unnecessary expense for roasting, which I eliminate, as hereinafter described. Ores of this character also usually carry iron, and this has proved an obstacle to nearly all processes used for extracting the copper from low-grade ores. I have found, however, that a certain proportion of sulfate of iron added to the solution used for leaching prevents to a large extent the solution from attacking the iron contained in the ore and at the same time adds greatly to the solvent power of the solution on the copper.  \n  My process is in outline as follows: The ore is first pulverized to a proper degree of fineness, then transferred to leaching-tanks of the usual description, and is leached with a solution composed of water, sulfuric acid, and sulfate of iron, prepared as follows: In the stock-tank used for making up solution the proper amount of water is first placed, then sulfuric acid is added to the water until the gravity reaches 7 1- to 8 Baum, which requires about six per cent. of ordinary commercial sulfuric acid. Then sulfate of iron is added in the proportion of about one to one and one-fourth per cent. of the total weight of water and acid combined. As soon as the sulfate of iron is dissolved the solution is ready for immediate use. It is passed into the leaching-tank on top of the ore and filters through it slowly, coming away from the filter-bottom as a blue solution, carrying the copper contents of the ore in the form of sulfate of copper. This solution passes at once to the deposition-tanks, where the copper is de posited either electrolytically or by any other suitable means. The solution being deprived of its copper, or the greater portion thereof, is returned to the stock-tank and is ready to pass through a second mass of pulverized ore. The solution in its passage through the ore oxtracts, as before stated, all of the copper present as carbonates, oxide, or metallic copper. The portion of copper present as sullids still remains in the ore and is insoluble in this solution. The ore is now washed from the leaching-tank and passed over concentrators. The sulfids being the heavier part of the ore are readily separated by the concentrators and are then oxidized by roasting or any other suitable means and are then ready to be added to the next charge of ore in one of the leaching-tanks. By this means it is only necessary to roast or otherwise oxidize the actual sulfids contained in the ore as distinguished from the usual proceeding of roasting the entire body of ore, and as in such ores the sullids frequently constitute as little as ten per cent. of the values in the ores the saving is very large.  \n  The solution mentioned above of sulfuric acid and water-7t to 8 Baum and one to one and one-fourth per cent. sulfate of iron added-has been found in practice to have the greatest possible solvent power on the copper contents of the ore when present in the forms mentioned above, also to have very little solvent action on the iron contained in the ore. The result in practice is that ore can be thoroughly leached by this solution in four hours, which would require ten or twelve hours if simply sulfuric acid and water Were used as a solvent. This solution is very valuable as facilitating the Work and saving time, causing a greater amount of copper to be extracted with the same size of apparatus in a given time than by the use of other solutions.  \n Having described my invention, I claim- 1.

GERHARDT, a citizen of the United States, residing at Milwaukee, county\u0026#39;of Milwaukee, and State of Wisconsin, have invented new and useful Improvements in Wrenches for Meat-Choppers, of which the following is a specification.  \n  My invention relates to improvements in wrenches for meat-choppers.  \n  The object of my invention is to provide a form of wrench adapted to be used for adjusting the annular holding-nut of meat-choppers similar to those shown in the patent to Baker, No. 339, 834:, dated April 13, 1886. In the meat-choppers of that class the meat is forced through a perforated plate which is held in position by a nut engaging the marginal edges of the plate and provided with both lateral and radial knobs, some of which are frequently broken in use.  \n  My invention contemplates a form of wrench which can be used on machines of various sizes and which is adapted to engage either the lateral knobs or the radial knobs, as desired.  \n  In the following description reference is had to the accompanying drawings, in Which Figure 1 is a rear view of a meat-chopper with my invention applied thereto in position of use and as it appears when engaging one of the lateral knobs of the holding-nut. Fig. 2 is a side view, partly in section, showing my invention as it is used for engaging one of the radial knobs on the holding-nut. Fig. 3 is a detail view of the adjustable fork for engaging the radial knobs.  \n  Like parts are identified by the same reference characters throughout the several views.  \n  In the meat-choppers of the above-mentioned type the shaft 1 is incased in a bearing-thimble 2. The wrench comprises a bar 0, having an aperture 4 near one end adapted to receive the bearing-thimble 2 and a slot 5 extending from said aperture 4 toward the end of the bar, the slot 5 being adapted to receive one of the lateral knobs 6 on the Serial No. 199,927. (No model.)  \n holding-nut 7. By adjusting the wrench, as shown in Fig. 1, with the bearing-thimble 2 entered in the aperture L and with the knob 6 projecting into the slot 5 it is obvious that the nut can be readily turned to remove or replace it in position of use. Where the knobs 6 are broken, as indicated in Fig. 2, a fork 8 is used to engage the radial knobs 9 on the ring 7 The fork 8 is provided with a shank 10, which passes through the slot 5 in the bar and is provided with aclamping-nut 11, which 1 when-turned up tightly against the bar will bind the fork forcibly in position. By loosening the nut 11 the fork 8 may be adjusted to any desired position, and thereby adapted to machines of various sizes. I/Vhen in use, one of the radial knobs 9 is entered between the arms of the fork, as indicated in Fig. 2.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. A wrench for adjusting the holding-rings of meat-choppers, comprising the bar having an aperture near one end adapted to receive the bearing-thimble of the meat-chopper shaft, said bar being also provided with a slot adapted to receive lateral projecting knobs on the holding-ring of the meat-chopper.  \n  2. A wrench for adjusting the holding-rings of meat-choppers, comprising a bar having an aperture near one end adapted to receive the bearing-thimble of the meat-chopper shaft, said bar being also provided with a slot adapted to receive lateral projecting knobs on the holding-ring of the meat-chopper, together with a fork, adjustably mounted on said. bar and adapted to engage radial knobs on the meat-chopper holding-ring.  \n  In testimony whereof I affix my signature in the presence of two witnesses.  \n ALI/VIN J.

Fig. 2 is a side view, partly in section, showing my invention as it is used for engaging one of the radial knobs on the holding-nut. Fig. 3 is a detail view of the adjustable fork for engaging the radial knobs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Like parts are identified by the same reference characters throughout the several views. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the meat-choppers of the above-mentioned type the shaft 1 is incased in a bearing-thimble 2. The wrench comprises a bar 0, having an aperture 4 near one end adapted to receive the bearing-thimble 2 and a slot 5 extending from said aperture 4 toward the end of the bar, the slot 5 being adapted to receive one of the lateral knobs 6 on the Serial No. 199,927. (No model.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eholding-nut 7. By adjusting the wrench, as shown in Fig. 1, with the bearing-thimble 2 entered in the aperture L and with the knob 6 projecting into the slot 5 it is obvious that the nut can be readily turned to remove or replace it in position of use. Where the knobs 6 are broken, as indicated in Fig. 2, a fork 8 is used to engage the radial knobs 9 on the ring 7 The fork 8 is provided with a shank 10, which passes through the slot 5 in the bar and is provided with aclamping-nut 11, which 1 when-turned up tightly against the bar will bind the fork forcibly in position. By loosening the nut 11 the fork 8 may be adjusted to any desired position, and thereby adapted to machines of various sizes. I/Vhen in use, one of the radial knobs 9 is entered between the arms of the fork, as indicated in Fig. 2. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1. A wrench for adjusting the holding-rings of meat-choppers, comprising the bar having an aperture near one end adapted to receive the bearing-thimble of the meat-chopper shaft, said bar being also provided with a slot adapted to receive lateral projecting knobs on the holding-ring of the meat-chopper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 2. A wrench for adjusting the holding-rings of meat-choppers, comprising a bar having an aperture near one end adapted to receive the bearing-thimble of the meat-chopper shaft, said bar being also provided with a slot adapted to receive lateral projecting knobs on the holding-ring of the meat-chopper, together with a fork, adjustably mounted on said. bar and adapted to engage radial knobs on the meat-chopper holding-ring. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In testimony whereof I affix my signature in the presence of two witnesses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALI/VIN J.

HUGHES, a citizen of the United States of America, .re siding in the borough of Brooklyn, in the county of Kings and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Fare-Registers, of which the following is a specification, reference being had to theaccompanying drawings, forming part of the same, in which Figure 1 is a face view of a fare-register embodying my invention, from which, however, the dial-face, the trip-hand, the permanent register, and some other parts have been removed to more clearly exhibit the parts of special moment herein. Fig. 2 is a face view, on a smaller scale, of the dial-face when ninetysix fares have been rung up on the particular trip then in progress. Fig. 3 is a similar View of the dial-face when one hundred and seven fares of the trip have been registered. Fig. L is a plan view of the mechanism for setting my especial-trip hundred-indicator in the position the parts occupy before one hundred fares have been registered on the trip. Fig. 5 is a plan View of said mechanism after one hundred fares have been registered on the one trip. Fig. 6 is a View, partially in perspective, of a portion of the dial, the onehundred slide, and the post or arm by which motion is transmitted to the slide. Fig. 7 is a sectional view of a part of the dial and slide, showing also in elevation the said post and its socket. Fig. 8 is a detail view of the above cam I prefer to employ to reset the one-hundred indicator.  \n My invention relates to fare-registers, and  \n particularly to mechanism for exhibiting the number of fares above one hundred registered on any one trip.  \n It consists in a combination of devices for showing movable figures adjacent to a fixed figure, as hereinafter set forth, and in various features more particularly pointed out in the claims. i  \n  In dial-registers as heretofore constructed it has generally been customary to have the dialface bear figures which will exhibit the number of fares up to one hundred and to provide by a separate register for exhibiting the total Serial No. 188,180. (No model.)  \n fares; but the difficulty has been that if more than one hundred fares were registered on any one trip there was no ready means of determining that fact. For instance, when one hundred and seven fares had been rung up the trip-hand would be in the position shown in Fig. 3, but an inspector or other person desirous of knowing how many fares had been received on that trip would be unable to tell from the dial-face whether seven or one hundred and seven had been rung up, and as many trips occur during which more than one hundred fares are received this want is an active one. It might be supplied by independent mechanism; but this is an expensive way and is liable to make the register too cumbersome or complicated. The severe service it must undergo renders it necessary the parts should be as simple and durable as possible. Space isof moment, as they must not be too large, and cost is, as almost always, aconsiderable factor. I have therefore endeavored to utilize the already present instrumentalities with as few and simple additions as possible, and 1 have accordingly conceived and devised a mechanism which utilizes the already-present\u0026#39; zeromark of the dial-face for showing that the hundred-mark has been reached, and I have arranged that when that occurs other figures should show alongside the zero, so as with it to make one hundred. Then a glance at the dial shows that it is one hundred and seven and not merely seven fares have been received on the trip. Such use of the zero entails, of course, that the additional figures shall be withdrawn from view whenever the trip-hand isset back to zero. I say zero and one hundred; but I do not limit myself to that designation. The same mechanism might readily be employed to register other things than one hundred or start with other than zero, as will be readily manifest.  \n  In the main the register I exhibit is one already well known and shown and explained in the expired United States Letters Patent Nos. 271,977 and 280,925. There is the triphand H, the trip-actuating spindle A, the resetting-shaft I), the trip-signal lever or bellcrank V, actuated by the movement of the setting-shaft D through the gears o s and pitman 2?. As is explained in those patents, the respective arms of this bell-crank are swung inward and upward at one setting and outward and downward at the next, and thus alternate.  \n  Now in carrying out my invention I cut in the dial-plateD two apertures (Z a, (one would do,) one on each side of the zero-mark. Beneath those apertures I place a slide S, bearing on its upper face the figures 1 and 0, so placed that when 1 is exposed through aperture (Z 0 will be also exposed through aperture a. This slide is provided with a socket S. Then I mount a lever Z on the frame of the machine, pivoted at p and provided with an upwardly-extending post P, adapted to enter and fit closely in socket S, the length of the parts and the position ofthe pivot being such that when the lever is swung over to one position, such as that shown in Fig. 5, the figures 1 and 0 will be exposed to view through apertures (Z a; but when swung to another position, such as that of Fig. 4, those figures will be moved out of registry with the apertures, and therefore be invisible. A swinging catch C, held down by spring and provided with a hook it and notch 71, will normally hold the lever Z in the Fig. 4: position, a cam-post 0 being provided to facilitate such holding, and a spring 8, attached to lever Z and to the frame, tends to draw the lever Z and post P to the position of Fig. 5.  \n  m m represent a hinged tripping-lever (also called a jointed double lever) pivoted at 72 jointed at 7) and extending up to and registering with the catch 0. From part 111/ a post P extends downward. The end of the part on lies, preferably, over within the line of the disk Z) on the trip-hand spindle A, and thereon I place a cam O in such position that it will engage post P when the trip hand begins to make its turn from 99 to 100. The resulting action is that the cam C, acting on post Pi will draw the tripping-lever m m downward and its upper end, held against catch 0 by the stress of spring s, connected to said lever on m and catch C, will enter notch 11. The instant cam C releases post P said spring s draws lever m m upward, that carries up the end of catch 0, stud c is released from the catch, and lever Z under the stress of spring a is swung to the right, carryl ng post P and slide S and exposing the figures 1 and 0 through apertures {Z a. They and the permanent zero make one hundred, and there is thus plainly exhibited the fact that one hundred fares have been registered during the trip, and the further progress of the trip-hand shows the further fares registered up to another hundred, which is as great or greater than the number usually collected on one trip. \\Vhen the trip is ended and the trip-hand reset, post P and slide S must of course be also reset, and to accomplish this I first provide a double cam-shaft C mounted in the frame and provided with a crank 7, having a socket f in its upper face, in which I locate a crank-pin 1)\u0026#34;, extending downward from the trip-signal slide S One of its camfaces, 0, engages the inner face of lever Z, and the other, 0 engages lever on. The operation of resetting is as follows: As already stated, in this operation the trip-signal slide is moved either up or down. Vith the parts in the position shown in Fig. 4: resetting would move said slide S upward, as shown in Fig. l, where the parts are in the position they occupy when the resetting has progressed about one-half of its complete movement. Slide S begins to move upward and acting through pin 7) and crank-arm f begins to swing the double camshaft (1 around as move the hands of a clock. Cam-face c bears against the right-hand side of lever Z and forces it to the left, thereby swinging its upper end and post P and slides S to the left toward their first position. (Jam-face c, acting against leverm, forces it from the notch in catch 0 and. leaves that free to drop and again hold stud c on lever Z, and thereby maintain that lever, its post, and the slide in the now new but really original position, the camface of that stud c forcing the catch up sulficiently to permit it thus returning. \\V hen the movement is complete, tl\u0026#39;e cam-shaft C will have turned so far around that the other sides of cam-faces c and 0 will respectively lie against lever Z and m, and at the next resetting the downward movement of slide S will by swingingcamshaft G around in a reverse direction accomplish exactly such a movement as that already described. If, however, the trip-hand had not reached 100 during the trip and the parts were still in the position shown in Fig. 4, the resetting of the trip-hand would not need to and would not produce any change in the position of the slide S. The cam-shaft would be swung about. The cam-faces would engage lever Z and m, but as the lever Z would be already at the limit of movement to which the cam could force it it would be moved no farther, while lever m would merely move back and forth without operative result. 7 In resetting the trip-hand, however, the momentum acquired by the disk Z under the vigorous twist of an athletic conductor is liable to turn so far as to bring the hand behind zerosay 92 or 99 and, though a step has been provided at w to prevent this, yet that stop is so placed as to stop the gear on the resetting-shaft. It does thercby to some extent control the gear on the central spindle, to which gear the hand is secured; but there is always a liability of lost motion between the gear, and the stop does not, therefore, entirely avoid the diflieulty. I have, however, devised a stop which does, to wit: a pawl W, secured to the frame and engaging a notch or cut in the disk Z) itself at such point that when the hand stands at zero the pawl will engage the notch and further retrograde movement be absolutely prevented, since the stop acts upon a part rigidly secured to the hand. It will thus be seen that by the addition of comparatively few parts I have substantially doubled the indicative capacity of the old trip-register by a simpler device than I formerly employed, though leaving the size of the dial and the clearness of its exhibition of figures exactly as before and rendering it unnecessary for users of the old dialplate to become accustomed to a new form or arrangement of the plate or its figures.  \n  What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. In a fare-register, the combination of a dial having an aperture therethrough, a slide bearing one or more figures, an arm pivoted at one end to the frame and carrying said slide, a spring secured \u0026#39;to said arm with its stress arranged to throw said arm to a registry position, an engaging device on said arm, a catch engaging said device on said. arm and adapted to lock it in a blank position, a jointed double lever secured to the frame and carrying an engaging device, a cam on the trip-actuator adapted to engage said engaging device on the jointed double lever, and a spring connected with the jointed double lever and with its stress arranged to throw the free arm of the jointed double lever into engagement with the catch and to then move the catch away from the engaging device on the slide-arm, all combined to operate as substantially set forth.  \n  2. In a fare-register, the combination of a dial having an aperture therethrough, a slide bearing one or more figures, an arm pivoted at one end to the frame and carrying said slide,  \n \u0026#39; a spring secured to said arm with its stress arranged to throw said arm to a registry posltion, an engaging device on said arm, a  \n catch engaging said device on said arm and adapted to lock it in a blank position, a jointed double lever secured to the frame and carrying an engaging device, a cam on the trip-actuator adapted to engage said engaging device on the jointed double lever, and a spring connected with the jointed double lever and with its stress arranged to throw the free arm of the jointed double lever into engagement with the catch and to then move the catch away from the engaging device on the slide-arm, a resetting mechanism, a cam connected with said resetting mechanism and interposed between the slide-arm and the free arm of the jointed double lever, all combined to operate substantially as set forth, whereby the resetting of the trip-hand will cause said cam between the slide-arm and the free arm of the jointed double lever to force them, respectively, to a blank position.  \n  3. In a fare-register, the combination of a dial bearing a sign, a slide bearing one or more signs which are the complement of the sign on the dial in indicating a given fact, a rigid arm pivoted at one end to the frame and, at its other end, carrying said slide bearing complementary signs, a tripping mechanism, connected with the trip-hand, whereby the rigid arm is released at a predetermined point, and mechanism substantially as set forth for moving said arm when released, all combined to operate substantially as set forth.  \n  In testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification, in the presence of two subscribing witnesses, this 6th day of January, 1904.  \n NATHAN B.

The cam-faces would engage lever Z and m, but as the lever Z would be already at the limit of movement to which the cam could force it it would be moved no farther, while lever m would merely move back and forth without operative result. 7 In resetting the trip-hand, however, the momentum acquired by the disk Z under the vigorous twist of an athletic conductor is liable to turn so far as to bring the hand behind zerosay 92 or 99 and, though a step has been provided at w to prevent this, yet that stop is so placed as to stop the gear on the resetting-shaft. It does thercby to some extent control the gear on the central spindle, to which gear the hand is secured; but there is always a liability of lost motion between the gear, and the stop does not, therefore, entirely avoid the diflieulty. I have, however, devised a stop which does, to wit: a pawl W, secured to the frame and engaging a notch or cut in the disk Z) itself at such point that when the hand stands at zero the pawl will engage the notch and further retrograde movement be absolutely prevented, since the stop acts upon a part rigidly secured to the hand. It will thus be seen that by the addition of comparatively few parts I have substantially doubled the indicative capacity of the old trip-register by a simpler device than I formerly employed, though leaving the size of the dial and the clearness of its exhibition of figures exactly as before and rendering it unnecessary for users of the old dialplate to become accustomed to a new form or arrangement of the plate or its figures. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

They operate by means of a finger located back of the upper jaw and above a slot in the lower jaw of the clip, which holds the upper jaw away from the cloth so long as it is prevented by the cloth from falling into the slot.. The better and more delicately-working clips have been made with the finger separate from the upper jaw and pivoted upon its own independent pivot. With very thin goods particularly it is important 5 that there be as little pressure as possible upon the goods by the finger while preserving the quick and positive action of the upper jaw when it is once released from the finger. Various attempts have been made to obtain .3 these results by counterbalancing a portion of the weight and in other ways; but so far as I know they have all proved in practicemore or less defective.  \n  My invention has in view the same object of reducing the weight upon the cloth,wl1ile permittingthe upper jaw to fall quickly when released; but I attain it in a new, simple, and effective manner.  \n  Figure 1 of the drawings is a plan view of 4 my clip. Fig. 2 is a front elevation, and Fig. 3 is a side sectional elevation on line 3 3 of Fig. 1. This last figure of the drawings most clearly shows my invention, and the two positions of the working parts are indicated thereonnarnely, when the clip is closed by full lines and when the clip is open by having the cloth under the finger by broken lines.  \n The upper jaw A is pivoted to the common and well-known overhanging arms B of the clip at 6 and has an arm or projection O upon its rear side. This arm O is so shaped as to have a downwardly-projecting hook D at its end. The lower jaw, as is common in these clips, consists of a plate P with a slot 1 in its center. The finger or controller is pivoted at 0 in the rear of the jaws; which is a common construction, and is constructed with a deep recess in its upper edge, which virtually divides it into two portionsfnam ely, the lower portion E,which forms the finger proper to rest upon the cloth, and the upper projection F, extending forward over the arm O for the purpose hereinafter explained. The lower portion or finger E has an upward projection or hook G upon its end. The two hooks D and G are so arranged that when the cloth is under the finger they will engage with one another to hold the upper jaw elevated above the cloth.  \n  The shape of the rear surface g of the hook G will control the sensitiveness of the clip. As this is the principle upon which my clip is constructed, it may be well to illustrate my meaning as well as to show how the clip may be made more or less sensitive in practice. It will be evident that if the two hooksD and Or were s ufiiiciently undercut and then caused to interlock they would hold up the upper jaw A and finger E without any cloth or other support under the finger E. Such an arrangement would of course be inoperative and useless, for the finger would not then drop into its slot to release the hook E and the upper jaw A when the cloth is withdrawn from under it; but if with the position of the pivot c as shown inythe drawings the surface g in stead of being undercut were made upon the circumference of a circle with the pivot e as a Center the weight upon the cloth would in the absence of friction between it and the hook D be substantially only the weight of the finger and controller; but it will be found by experiment that with the pivot in the position I have placed it-namely, on a level with and to find such a slant that the downward pressure of the finger due to the weight upon it will be sufficient to overcome the friction, and thereby make the device operative. 1n practice this slant forward will have to be sufiicient to make the clip work positively and.  \n with certainty. The exact shape will vary with the location of the pivot e and probably with differently-proportioned parts, but can be readily ascertained by experiment. It is, however, entirely feasible to sustain in this manner much of the weight which would otherwise rest on the cloth, leaving only a sufiicient downward pressure upon the finger to insure the proper working of the clip.  \n  Clips constructed upon this principle possess the great practical advantage that they do not require the fine individual adjustment of parts which is necessary in some of the more practicable clips heretofore constructed. Their parts can therefore be more readily made to conform to templets and patterns and then indiscriminately assembled into complete operative clips.  \n  The clamp is preferably opened by a wedgeslide attached in the usual manner to the machine, so placed as to come into contact with the boss H upon the front of the upper jaw A as the clip is moved around the tenter. As the jaw A is thus pressed backward, the arm C attached thereto comes into contact with the upper prong F of the controller to throw it upward and backward, and thereby lift the finger E above the slot in the lower jaw ready to receive the cloth under it.  \n  The upper jaw A is pivoted to the overhanging arms B B by a rod K passing through these arms and the upwardly-projecting cars a a of the jaw A. Between the arms B B a sleeve L surrounds the rod K, and a cotter-pin through the sleeve L and the rod K keeps the latter in place without upsetting or riveting its ends, and thereby renders it easy to take the clamp apart whenever it is necessary to make any repairs upon it. The same arrangement is used upon the pivot for the controller, except that the sleeve is in this instance made integral with the controller, thereby performing the functions both of the cars a a and of the sleeve.  \n 1 claim as my invention- 1.

WOLF, citizens of the United States, residing at De Queen, in the county of Sevier and State of Arkansas, have invented a new and useful Agricultural. Boiler, of, which.  \n the following is aspecification.- This inventio relates\u0026#34; l I ncuatiaiboiiers; and it has\u0026#39;for its object to provide a device of this class which,lwhile adapted to avariety of purposes requiring hot water, such as cooking feed for the fattening of cattle, and for other similar purposes, shall be especially adapted for the purpose of preparing and putting up fruit, vegetables, and the like.  \n In agricultural communities, and especially f in the fruit-growing sections of the country,  \n immense quantities of valuable fruits are. an-  \n nually wasted on account of the inability ofv the farmer to market them or to convey them in season to the. canneries. .A considerable proportion of such wastage might be saved if the farmer were in aposition himself to can and preserve such fruits and vegetables as cannot otherwise be well disposed of. It is to provide a convenient and inexpensive appa-. ratus through the medium of which this result may be accomplished that our invention is aimed; and it has for its object to provide a device of this class which shall possess su-- perior advantages inpoint of simplicity, du-  \n rability, and general efiiciency.  \n  With these and other ends in view theinvention consists in the improved construction, 3S  \n arrangement, and combination of parts which will be hereinafter fully described, and particularly pointed out in the appended claims.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, Figure l is a longitudinal sectionalview of a-device constructed in accordance .with the principles of our invention. V Fig. 2 is a, verticaltransverse sectional view taken on the line \u0026#39;2 2 of Fig. 1.  \n  Corresponding parts in both figures are indicated by similar characters of reference.  \n  The casing l, which constitutes the\u0026#39;furnace member of our improved, device, consists mainly of a rectangular box which may be constructed of sheet metal and which is supported at itscorners upon legs 2, elevating it a suitable distance above\u0026#39;the ground. The  \n serial ,093. (No modelJ front end 3-of the box or casing is provided with a door 4:, through which fuelmay be fed into the combustion-chamber, which latter is provided with alining 5, composed ofa sheet of metal suitably curved, as clearly shownin Fig. %\u0026#34;of the drawings. \u0026#39;The front lining plate 7 is disposed against the rear wall of the furnace-chamber, said lining-plate be- 1 v ing provided with flanges 8, abutting againstsaid rearwall, thereby forming an air-space j\u0026#39;e\u0026#39;iid 3 of the casing has\u0026#39; a curved upper\u0026#39;edge\u0026#39; (designated 6) to support the-front end of the tank, as will be presently\u0026#39;deseribed. A.  \n which serves to prevent the waste ofheat by radiation and which also prevents the-said rear wall from burning out.

Serial No. 160,392. (No model.)  \n To all whom it may concern.-  \n Be it known that I, GEORGE BAEI-IR, a resident of McKeesport, in the county of Allegheny and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Flexible Couplings; and I do hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description thereof.  \n  My invention relates to flexible couplings for shafts and the like; and its object is to provide a coupling of this character which is simple of construction, comparatively cheap, eflicient in operation, and which can be readily put in place or permit the easy removal and replacement of either of the shaft-sections.  \n  In many connections it is desirable to have two shaft-sections coupled together flexibly, in order that the vibration or motion of one section may not be communicated to the other. Such couplings are not, broadly, new; but all prior couplings, as far as I am aware, are ex-. pensive to make, rather complicated to put in place, and seriously interfere with the removal and replacement of either of the shaftsections.  \n  My invention is designed to produce a flexible coupling wherein the foregoing difficulties are overcome, and to this end it comprises two disks adapted for connection to the shaft-sections and provided with plain meeting faces, said disks having registering holes by means of which they are connected by belts or the like, the holes in one of said disks being much larger than in the other and having soft com: pressible bushings, such as soft sponge-rubber, placed in said openings around the bolts.  \n The invention also comprises certain details of construction, such as making the en larged holes elliptical with the long axes substantially in the line of the radius of the disks and also providing metallic bushings around the bolts to prevent wear of the rubber bushings.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is an end elevation of the coupling device, some of the securing-bolts being omitted the better to show the construction; and Fig. 2 is side view thereof, partly in section.  \n  The coupling device comprises two disks 1 and 2, each of which is provided with a hub 3, adapted for attachment to the shaft-sections by any suitable arrangement, such as a key and slot A. These disks are provided with registering openings \u0026#39;5 and 6, respectively, those. in one of the disks, such as the openings 6, being much larger than those in the other disk. Theholes 5 are screw-tapped, and the disks are united by threaded bolts 7, passing through the holes 5 and 6 and screwed into the latter and also secured by means of nuts 8. In each hole 6, surrounding the bolt 7 is a bushing 9, of soft compressible material, such as sponge-rubber or the like. Preferably the disk 2 will be much thicker than the disk 1, so as to provide wide bearings for these compressible bushings. It will be at once apparent that in the rotation of the coupling members this compressible material will, yield, thus preventing the transmission of shocks from one shaft member to the other and also permitting one shaft member to take a slight annular position with reference to the other. In order to permit the rubber to yield the more readily, the openings 6 are not made quite circular, but are slightly elliptical, as shown in Fig. 1, the longer axis of said openings being approximately in radial lines of the disks. Consequently when the bushings are not under compression there will be slight openings or vacant spaces on opposite sides thereof, as indicated at 10, and when the pressure comes on the, bushings they will squeeze into these openings, so that the latter afford a space into which the bushings may flow freely, thus rendering said bushings exceedingly elastic.  \n  To prevent the bolts 7 from cutting into or rapidly wearing the soft compressible bushings, they are surrounded bymetal sleeves or bushings 12, which are of slightly larger diameter than the bolts, but fit closely in the rubber bushings. These metal sleeves will practically take all the wear of the bolts.  \n  My coupling member is very simple to make, as the holes 6 can be formed in casting the disk 2 and need not be machined out. The parts can all be readily assembled by reason of the plain meeting faces of the disks 1 and 2, and either of the shaft-sections can be removed and replaced without disturbing the other, it only being necessary to remove the securing-bolts 7, when either shaft-section can be taken out. The rubber bushings 9 are very elastic, and this elasticity is increased by reason of the non-circular shape of the holes in which they are placed. Said rubber bushings, however, are held in the holes 6 with sufficient friction, so that when the coupling member is removed they will not fall out and become displaced.  \n  \\Vhile l have shown all the large holes 6 in one of the disks and all the small holes 5 in the other disk, I wish it understood that the invention is not limited thereto, as the large and small holes may be alternately placed in o pposite disks, although for cheapness an d convenience in manufacture the arrangement shownin the drawings is preferred.  \n  Instead of the bolts 7 it is obvious that rivets or other similar connecting members may be employed. v  \n  WV hat I claim as my invention, to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. A shaft-coupling comprising two disks adapted for attachment to shaft-sections, said. disks having fiat meeting faces and being provided with registering holes, bolts passing through said holes and serving to secure said disks together, one hole of each pair being much larger than the bolt, and bushings of compressible material in said large holes surrounding the bolts.  \n  2. A shaft-coupling comprising two disks adapted for attachment to shaft\u0026#39;sections, studs on one of said disks projecting into holes in the other disk, said holes being much larger and desire than said studs, and bushings of soft spongerubber in said holes around said studs.  \n  A shaft-coupling comprising two disks adapted for attachment to shaft-sections, said disks having fiat meeting faces and being provided with registering holes, bolts passing through said holes and serving to connect said disks, one hole of each pair being non-circular and much larger than the bolt, and bushings of soft compressible material in said large holes around the bolts.  \n  4;. A shaft-coupling comprising two disks adapted for attachment to shaft-sections and being provided with registering holes, bolts passing through said holes and serving to connect said disks, one hole of each pair being much larger than the bolt and being elliptical in form with its axis substantially in the radial line of the disk, and sleeves of soft compressible material in said large holes around the bolts.  \n  5. A shaft-coupling comprising two disks adapted for attachment to shaft-sections, one of said disks being provided with a series of holes, studs on the other disk and projecting into said holes and being much smaller than said holes, bushings of soft compressible ma terial in said holes, and metal sleeves or bushings in said soft compressible bushing and surrounding said studs.  \n  6. A shaft-coupling comprising two disks adapted for attachment to shaft-sections, said disks having flat meeting faces and being pro vided with registering holes, one of said disks being thicker than the other, bolts passing through said holes, the holes in the thicker disk being much larger than the bolts, and bushings of compressible material in said holes around said bolts.  \n  In testimony whereof I, the said Gnonon BAEHR, have hereunto set my hand.  \n GEORGE BAEHR.  \n \\V i tnesses:  \n J.

In order to permit the rubber to yield the more readily, the openings 6 are not made quite circular, but are slightly elliptical, as shown in Fig. 1, the longer axis of said openings being approximately in radial lines of the disks. Consequently when the bushings are not under compression there will be slight openings or vacant spaces on opposite sides thereof, as indicated at 10, and when the pressure comes on the, bushings they will squeeze into these openings, so that the latter afford a space into which the bushings may flow freely, thus rendering said bushings exceedingly elastic. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To prevent the bolts 7 from cutting into or rapidly wearing the soft compressible bushings, they are surrounded bymetal sleeves or bushings 12, which are of slightly larger diameter than the bolts, but fit closely in the rubber bushings. These metal sleeves will practically take all the wear of the bolts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My coupling member is very simple to make, as the holes 6 can be formed in casting the disk 2 and need not be machined out. The parts can all be readily assembled by reason of the plain meeting faces of the disks 1 and 2, and either of the shaft-sections can be removed and replaced without disturbing the other, it only being necessary to remove the securing-bolts 7, when either shaft-section can be taken out. The rubber bushings 9 are very elastic, and this elasticity is increased by reason of the non-circular shape of the holes in which they are placed. Said rubber bushings, however, are held in the holes 6 with sufficient friction, so that when the coupling member is removed they will not fall out and become displaced. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \\Vhile l have shown all the large holes 6 in one of the disks and all the small holes 5 in the other disk, I wish it understood that the invention is not limited thereto, as the large and small holes may be alternately placed in o pposite disks, although for cheapness an d convenience in manufacture the arrangement shownin the drawings is preferred. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Instead of the bolts 7 it is obvious that rivets or other similar connecting members may be employed. v \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e WV hat I claim as my invention, to secure by Letters Patent, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

(No model.)  \n To rt/,Z r11/mm, t may concern,.-  \n  Be it known that I, ERNEST H. FOSTER, a citi- Zen of the United States, residing at New York, county and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Hydraulic Rams, of which the following is a specification, reference being had to the drawings accompanying and forming part of the same.  \n  Heretofore in the manufacture of rams of large size and power it `has been found that the working or waste valve gives out after the apparatus has been in use but a comparatively short time. This is duc to the great unbalanced or unsupported area necessary in a working valve of large size, on account of which the shock of sudden closing exerts a strain which the valve cannot long sustain. In order to overcome this diflculty, so that rams of large size may be constructed which will have as long life as the less powerful ones now in use, I have devised a waste-valve which with large capacity has very small unsupported area.  \n  My invention, which consists of the novel features and combinations more particularly pointed out in the claims, is illustrated in the drawings, in which- Figure 1 is a section of a ram having my improved valve. Fig. 2 is a top planview of the valve. Fig. 3 is a section on line 3 3 of Fig. 2. Figs. 4 and 5 are section and plan, respectively, of a modification.  \n  The drive-pipe 1 is of any convenient form and is connected in the usual manner with an air-chamber 2, having suitable valves 3.  \n  In lieu of the customary single escape or working valve I use a double arrangement consisting of a pilot-valve 4 and a main valve 5. The pilot-valve consists, preferably, of a disk 6, adapted to iit a seat 7 and carrying a vertical stem 8. The opening and closing of this valve diiers in no way from the operation of the ordinary waste-valve; but it is much smaller than would be required for a ram of the size on which it is used. In order,  \n therefore, to compensate for its small size, I  \n employ another valve 5, closed not directly by the friction of the escaping water, but by the pilot-valve.  \n , The valve 5 consists of a gridiron-plate 9, sliding in suitable guideways formed by the flanged plate 10 on the upper side ofthe drivepipe and preferably adjacent the pilot-valve. Immediately below the sliding plate 9 are similar openings in the drive-pipe, as shown, to register with those in the plate 9. The plate carries a bail 11, having connected thereto a jointed connecting-rod 12, which latter is connected to one arm of a bell-crank lever 13, pivotally mounted on an arm 14. The other arm of the bell-crank is connected to the vertical stem 8 of the pilot-valve.  \n  It will be readily understood from the foregoing that by means of the screw-thread devices 15 on the end of the rod 12 the relation between the -pilot-valve and the plate-valve may be so adjusted that when the former is opened by the fall of pressure in the drivepipe the latter will move forward, so as to ybring the two sets of openings into register. The water in the pipe 1 now has ample means of escape through the openings 16 17. When the flow through 16 has attained a sufficient momentum, the pilot-valve closes suddenly in the usual manner, closing, by means of the connecting-levers, the plate also, after which the water enters the air-chamber. Thus it will be seen that while thev valves for the waste are of large capacity they are so constructed as to have very small unsupported areas. Consequently the impact of the water as they are closed is sustained without danger of the valve giving way. At the same time they may be made comparatively light in weight, thereby eecting an appreciable economy in manufacture. The pilot-valve being operated by a volume of water much greater than is sufficient merely t0 close it, develops enough power to actuate the valve 5 with certainty-that is, the latter is not too heavy a load to prevent the system from always operating. On the other hand, the load is sufcient to dampen or check the speed of the pilot-valve in closing, so that the shock and consequent strain is considerably reduced without materially affecting the eiiiciency of the engine.  \n  The operation oi\u0026#39; the modified form shown in Figs. and 5 is essentially the same as the foregoing. In this form a rotary plate-valve 17 is substituted for the sliding plate, having a cranl-arm 18 and crank 19, which latter is connected to the bell-crank lever by the rod 20. Thus the opening and closing of the pilot-valve will rotate the other to cover or uncover the corresponding openings 21 in the drive-pipe.  \n  It is obvious that my invention is capable of many embodiments other than the one described, and therefore I do not consider myselil limited thereto. For example, other forms of valves might be used or other means of operatively connecting\u0026#39; the two together, or the pilot-valve might be arranged to operate a plurality of main valves. Many other variations will readily suggest themselves to the engineer or any one skilled in this art.  \n Therefore what I claim is-w 1. In a hydraulic ram, the combination of a drive-pipe, a pilot waste-valve, a second waste-valve, and means connecting\u0026#39; said valves whereby said second waste-valve is operated by said pilot-valve, as set forth.  \n 2.

FOSTER, a citi- Zen of the United States, residing at New York, county and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Hydraulic Rams, of which the following is a specification, reference being had to the drawings accompanying and forming part of the same. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Heretofore in the manufacture of rams of large size and power it `has been found that the working or waste valve gives out after the apparatus has been in use but a comparatively short time. This is duc to the great unbalanced or unsupported area necessary in a working valve of large size, on account of which the shock of sudden closing exerts a strain which the valve cannot long sustain. In order to overcome this diflculty, so that rams of large size may be constructed which will have as long life as the less powerful ones now in use, I have devised a waste-valve which with large capacity has very small unsupported area. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention, which consists of the novel features and combinations more particularly pointed out in the claims, is illustrated in the drawings, in which- Figure 1 is a section of a ram having my improved valve. Fig. 2 is a top planview of the valve. Fig. 3 is a section on line 3 3 of Fig. 2. Figs. 4 and 5 are section and plan, respectively, of a modification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The drive-pipe 1 is of any convenient form and is connected in the usual manner with an air-chamber 2, having suitable valves 3. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In lieu of the customary single escape or working valve I use a double arrangement consisting of a pilot-valve 4 and a main valve 5. The pilot-valve consists, preferably, of a disk 6, adapted to iit a seat 7 and carrying a vertical stem 8. The opening and closing of this valve diiers in no way from the operation of the ordinary waste-valve; but it is much smaller than would be required for a ram of the size on which it is used. In order, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etherefore, to compensate for its small size, I \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemploy another valve 5, closed not directly by the friction of the escaping water, but by the pilot-valve. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, The valve 5 consists of a gridiron-plate 9, sliding in suitable guideways formed by the flanged plate 10 on the upper side ofthe drivepipe and preferably adjacent the pilot-valve. Immediately below the sliding plate 9 are similar openings in the drive-pipe, as shown, to register with those in the plate 9. The plate carries a bail 11, having connected thereto a jointed connecting-rod 12, which latter is connected to one arm of a bell-crank lever 13, pivotally mounted on an arm 14. The other arm of the bell-crank is connected to the vertical stem 8 of the pilot-valve. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be readily understood from the foregoing that by means of the screw-thread devices 15 on the end of the rod 12 the relation between the -pilot-valve and the plate-valve may be so adjusted that when the former is opened by the fall of pressure in the drivepipe the latter will move forward, so as to ybring the two sets of openings into register. The water in the pipe 1 now has ample means of escape through the openings 16 17. When the flow through 16 has attained a sufficient momentum, the pilot-valve closes suddenly in the usual manner, closing, by means of the connecting-levers, the plate also, after which the water enters the air-chamber. Thus it will be seen that while thev valves for the waste are of large capacity they are so constructed as to have very small unsupported areas. Consequently the impact of the water as they are closed is sustained without danger of the valve giving way. At the same time they may be made comparatively light in weight, thereby eecting an appreciable economy in manufacture. The pilot-valve being operated by a volume of water much greater than is sufficient merely t0 close it, develops enough power to actuate the valve 5 with certainty-that is, the latter is not too heavy a load to prevent the system from always operating. On the other hand, the load is sufcient to dampen or check the speed of the pilot-valve in closing, so that the shock and consequent strain is considerably reduced without materially affecting the eiiiciency of the engine. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The operation oi' the modified form shown in Figs. and 5 is essentially the same as the foregoing. In this form a rotary plate-valve 17 is substituted for the sliding plate, having a cranl-arm 18 and crank 19, which latter is connected to the bell-crank lever by the rod 20. Thus the opening and closing of the pilot-valve will rotate the other to cover or uncover the corresponding openings 21 in the drive-pipe. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is obvious that my invention is capable of many embodiments other than the one described, and therefore I do not consider myselil limited thereto. For example, other forms of valves might be used or other means of operatively connecting' the two together, or the pilot-valve might be arranged to operate a plurality of main valves. Many other variations will readily suggest themselves to the engineer or any one skilled in this art. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore what I claim is-w 1.

Serial No. 155,136. (No model.)  \n  fication.  \n  This invention relates to breech loading breakdown firearms of the so-called hammerless kind or that in which the hammer is concealed, and has for its object to provide an improved mechanism for cocking the hammer operated by the breakingdown of the barrel.  \n  In the present instance the invention is shown as applied to a double-barrel gun; but it may also be used with a single barrel.  \n  Referring to the accompanying drawings, in which similar figures of reference indicate like parts, Figure 1 is a side view, in longitudinal section, of a portion of the barrels and breech of a gun with the breech closed and hammer down and showing the invention. Fig. 2 is a similar View with the barrels broken down and the hammers cocked. Fig. 3 is a similar View with the barrels closed and the hammers cooked for firing. Fig. 4. is a perspective View of a hammer detached, showing its slotted construction at the pivotal point.  \n  1 indicates the breech-piece or frame of the gun, to which are pivoted, by means of the hinge-pin 2, barrels 4, on which is mounted the fore-end 3.  \n  In describing this invention it will be understood that the operating mechanism is duplicated to adapt it to a double-barreled gun.  \n  The breech-piece or frame 1 iscut away to form the chamber 5, in which are located the hammers 6, pivoted on the pin 7 and having the striking-point 8, the hammers being operated in the usual way and the striking-point 8 falling into and projecting through an aperture-hole 9 in the wall of the chamber 5 to strike against the primer of the cartridge. Below each hammer 6 is located a hinged sear 10, having its forward end normally beneath and resting against the heel of the hammer 6, as shown in Fig. 1, and when the hammer is cooked dropping into and engaging the notch 11 in the rear of the heel to hold the hammer in cocked position, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.  \n  In order to cook the hammers by the breaking down of the barrels, the following mechanism is employed: Mounted upon the hingepin 2 is a cam-roller l2, suitably connected with the fore-end 3 and, as here shown, by means of a V-shaped notch 13 in the cam-roller, with which engages a V- shaped projection 14 on the fore-end 3, whereby when the barrels are broken down the roller 12 will be turned on the pin 2. Opening into the chamber 5 and extending forward to within a short distance of the roller 12 is a tubular passage-way 15, terminating at its forward end in a shoulder 16, and extending from the forward end of the passage-way 15 is a similar smaller tubular passage-way 17, opening into the socket, in which is seated the roller 12. Located in the rear end of the passage-way 15 is a tubular nut or sleeve 18, secured in place by screwthreads 19 or other suitable means, and extending through the sleeve 18 and the passageways 15 and 17 is a cooking slide-pin 20, having its forward .end normally in engagement with a recessed shouldered portion 21 of the roller 12. In the forward end of the passageway 15 is located a nut 22, mounted on the cocking-pin 20 and screw-threaded thereon, so as to be adjustable to regulate the tension of a coiled spring 23, mounted on the pin 20 and located between the sleeve 18 and nut 22. The nut 22 serves to compress the spring 23 when the cocking-pin 20 is pushed back by the rotation of the roller 12 when the barrels are broken down.  \n  Referring to Fig. 4c, the hammer 6 is shown as formed with a vertical slot 2 across which extends the pivot-pin 7 and also a pin 25, eecentric to the pin 7 The rear end of the cooking slide-pin 20 is formed with a hook 26, which projects into the slot 24: of the hammer 6 and loosely straddles or encircles the pin 25, permitting of a little play or lost motion between the hammer and the cocking-pin.  \n  The operation of the device is as follows: When the barrels are broken down, the roller 12 is thereby rotated and pushes back the cocking-pin 20, the nut 22 compressing the spring23. In the rearward movement of the pin 20 the latter through its hook 26 pushes back the hammer 6 until the sear 10 engages the notch 11 in the hammer and holds the latter in cocked position. The barrels being closed, the gun is ready for firing. When the gun is discharged and the hammer returns to its normal position, the nut 22 serves to limit the forward movement of the pin 20 by coming in contact with the shoulder 16 of passageway 15, thereby taking the tension of the spring 23 off of the hammer as soon as the gun is fired and\u0026#39;allowing the striking end of the hammer to drop back out of the indentation in the primer,owing to the loose connection of the hook 26 with the pin 25. The hammer-point is thus not only away from the primer, but also by its position permits the rear end of the barrel to clear it when the barrel is broken down.  \n  The invention is not limited to the exact construction or arrangement of the roller, cocking-pin, and connections with the hammer as herein set forth, as the parts could be so arranged that the roller would pull the cocking-pin instead of pushing it and the hammer be pulled back instead of pushed back.  \n  The invention covers the construction whether used with one or two barrels, in the latter case the parts being merely duplicated.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what I desire to secure and claim by Letters Patent 1. In a breech-loadingbreakdown gun,abarforth.  \n  2. In a breech-loading breakdown gun, abarrel, and fore-end hinged to the breech-piece, in combination with a roller mounted to rotate on the hinge-pin and rigidly connected to and rotated by the fore-end, and having a recessed shoulder, a sliding cocking-pin having its forward end normally abutting against said shoulder and operated by said roller, and its rear end, formed with a hook, a retractingspring on said pin, and a nut limiting the outward movement of the pin; and a hammer having a pin loosely engaged by the hook of the cocking-pin, said cocking-pin having a limited movement independent of the ham mer, as and for the purposeset forth.  \n  In testimonywhereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence oftwo subscribing witnesses.  \n  HARRY H.

Below each hammer 6 is located a hinged sear 10, having its forward end normally beneath and resting against the heel of the hammer 6, as shown in Fig. 1, and when the hammer is cooked dropping into and engaging the notch 11 in the rear of the heel to hold the hammer in cocked position, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In order to cook the hammers by the breaking down of the barrels, the following mechanism is employed: Mounted upon the hingepin 2 is a cam-roller l2, suitably connected with the fore-end 3 and, as here shown, by means of a V-shaped notch 13 in the cam-roller, with which engages a V- shaped projection 14 on the fore-end 3, whereby when the barrels are broken down the roller 12 will be turned on the pin 2. Opening into the chamber 5 and extending forward to within a short distance of the roller 12 is a tubular passage-way 15, terminating at its forward end in a shoulder 16, and extending from the forward end of the passage-way 15 is a similar smaller tubular passage-way 17, opening into the socket, in which is seated the roller 12. Located in the rear end of the passage-way 15 is a tubular nut or sleeve 18, secured in place by screwthreads 19 or other suitable means, and extending through the sleeve 18 and the passageways 15 and 17 is a cooking slide-pin 20, having its forward .end normally in engagement with a recessed shouldered portion 21 of the roller 12. In the forward end of the passageway 15 is located a nut 22, mounted on the cocking-pin 20 and screw-threaded thereon, so as to be adjustable to regulate the tension of a coiled spring 23, mounted on the pin 20 and located between the sleeve 18 and nut 22. The nut 22 serves to compress the spring 23 when the cocking-pin 20 is pushed back by the rotation of the roller 12 when the barrels are broken down. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring to Fig. 4c, the hammer 6 is shown as formed with a vertical slot 2 across which extends the pivot-pin 7 and also a pin 25, eecentric to the pin 7 The rear end of the cooking slide-pin 20 is formed with a hook 26, which projects into the slot 24: of the hammer 6 and loosely straddles or encircles the pin 25, permitting of a little play or lost motion between the hammer and the cocking-pin. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The operation of the device is as follows: When the barrels are broken down, the roller 12 is thereby rotated and pushes back the cocking-pin 20, the nut 22 compressing the spring23. In the rearward movement of the pin 20 the latter through its hook 26 pushes back the hammer 6 until the sear 10 engages the notch 11 in the hammer and holds the latter in cocked position. The barrels being closed, the gun is ready for firing. When the gun is discharged and the hammer returns to its normal position, the nut 22 serves to limit the forward movement of the pin 20 by coming in contact with the shoulder 16 of passageway 15, thereby taking the tension of the spring 23 off of the hammer as soon as the gun is fired and'allowing the striking end of the hammer to drop back out of the indentation in the primer,owing to the loose connection of the hook 26 with the pin 25.

Serial No. 145,776. (No model.)  \n T all whom, t may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, AUGUs\u0026#39;r WILLIAM Sonno- BER, a citizen of the United States, residing at Hoboken, in the county of Hudson and State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Safety-Razor Frames or Casings, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact speciiication.  \n The object of my invention is to provide a 1o casing having as few parts as possible wherein the blade may be readily inserted or removed therefrom without danger of injuring it; and it consists of the combinations, parts,  \n \u0026#39; and improvements hereinafter more fully set I 5 forth, and particularly pointed out\u0026#39; in the claims. i  \n  It further consists in providing an absolutely rigid support for the blade, no matter how imperfectly or unevenly it may be ground,  \n 2o and the invention provides that the blade automatically adjusts itself in a proper position upon being inserted in the casing.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, illustrating two forms of my invention, Figure 1 is a front z5 perspective view showing the casing and a blade in place therein, and Fig. 2 a side view of the casing complete. Fig. 3 is a perspective View of the rear. of the casing; and Fig. t a top view showing the\u0026#39;guard-comb, bladesupport, and clips. Fig. is a sectional view taken on lines m of Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is a side view similar to Fig. 2, but showing the lip for holding the blade thrown back and the clips raised; and Fig. 7 is a sectional view 3\u0026#39;5\u0026#39; taken -on lines y y of Fig. 3. Another form of my invention is shown in the second sheet of drawings, wherein Fig.\u0026#39; 8 is aside sectional view taken on lines e z ofv Fig. 10; Fig. 9, a \u0026#39;side View; Fig. 10, a top view of the bladeholder, guard-teeth, \u0026amp;c.; Fig. 11, a sidesectional view similar to Fig. 8, but showing the sliding lip pulled out for the insertion of the blade; Figs. 12 and 13, front and top views of` `the spring for operating the various parts; and Fig. 14 is a perspective view of the sliding lip. Fig. 15 is a detailed view of a portion of the blade-support, hereinafter more particularly described.  \n  In the drawings, 1 represents the conventional casing having the handle 2, and\u0026#39;to this casing is pivoted, as at 3, the blade-support 4:, provided with the usual guard-teeth 5. To the blade-support and at the ends and back thereof is pivoted the clip-frame 6, consisting of the arms 7 7, carrying the clips 8 and the cross-arm 9, having a slight elevation or projection 10 on its upper side at its middle portion. To the inner and rear face of the bladesupport is rigidly secured the yoke-shaped spring llt-for instance, by the rivets 12 12H and this spring serves the following purposes: The ends 13 13 normally press rearwardly against the lugs or shoulders 14L 14 on the clipframe, and thereby exert a constant tension serving to keep the clips down in contact with the top of the blade-support, as in Fig. 2. The head of the` yoke 15 bears against a lug 16 on the end of the lip or finger 17, which finger is pivoted to swing at the back of the blade-support, as will be readily understood from Fig. 5, and serves to hold the lip in either of two \u0026#39;positions -tirst, when swung forward to bear against the back of the blade, and, second, when swung back for the insertion of the blade, as shown vin Fig. 6. The projecting tongue 18 of this spring has a small projection 19 struck from its surface, which is adapted to engage arecess 20 in the casing, and this acts as a catch which secures the blade-support to the casing and which can be readily operated by the buttonk 21, secured to the spring. It is obvious that by pressing on this button the catch is not only released, but the blade-support is swung open by the same movement. It will likewise be readily -seen thatwhen the lip 17 is sw ung backward for the insertion of the blade it strikes the elevation \u0026#39;10 of the cross-arm 9 and forces it slightly downward, thereby raising the clips and permitting a ready insertion of the blade as far as the stops or studs 22, but no farther, as the clips are not raised high enough to permit the blade to be lifted or forcedover the said stops. Upon swinging the lip 17 forward the pressure on the cross arm @is removed and the clipsare forced downward on the face of the blade by means of the spring-arms 13, and the clips bearing against the back of the blade .hold it firmly in place against all movement.  \n It will thus be seen that a single spring not only governs the clips and the lip at the back of the blade, but operates the catch holding the blade-support to the casing.  \n  In razors with casings of this type wherein the proper position of the blade is determined by its edge abutting against fixed stops, such as 22, considerable danger exists of breaking the edge of the blade at these points, and this is particularly so where the blade is forced against the stops by a strong spring action, as in the device above described. To lessen this danger, I have produced a modified structure, which, while embodying the general features of my said casing, is provided with a sliding lip or finger for pressing the blade into place which has no tendency to force the blade forward suddenly, but which will hold it firmly when in place.  \n  In the drawings, 23 represents the sliding\u0026#39; lip having the upturned portion 24 for engagement with the back of the blade. It slides back and forth in a recess or cavity 25, formed in the top of the blade-support, and has a depending portion 26, moving between the prongs 27 of the bent arm of the spring 1l. These prongs normally press upward against the under surface of the recess within which the bladeholding lip moves, and thus forcing it against the under surface of the recess serve to hold the lip securely in any desired position. As in the first form of my invention,when moved back for the insertion of the blade the lip slides over and bears down upon the elevation l0 of the cross-arm \u0026#39;9, thereby depressing it and raising the clips for the insertion of the blade. After the blade is inserted the lip is pushed forward, thereby releasing the clips and permitting them to press down upon the blade,while the back of the ylip is moved up to engage against the back of the blade. The tension of the spring-arm 27 causes sufficient friction to retain the lip in the adjusted position and hold it firmly against movement.  \n  In making safety-razor blades the grinding is usually done by hand, and it is almost impossible to grind them uniformly, no two blades ever being of exactly the same bevel or pitch. It thus happens that very few blades will fit accurately upon any given casing, there often being some slight tipping because of the prominence of one supporting portion over another. This impairs the rigidity and firmness of the device, and in order to obviate this difficulty I have devisedv a structure wherein the blade-support is provided with three points of contact upon which the blade is held or supported when in position. These points of contact are the two front portions of the support just back of the studs 22.which support theends of the edge of the blade, and  \n a third point of contact, which I have placed at the center near the back of the blade-support, utilizing the upper rounded face or surface 28 of the recess or box 25, which is raised slightly higher than the sides of the rear of the blade-holder, as will be seen in dotted lines in Figs. 9 and 15.  \n  In Fig. 15 a section of the upper face or surface 28 of the box 25 is shown and a p0rtion of a blade in contact therewith. It will readily be seen that the rear support for thel blade having no appreciable surface affords no opportunity for the blade to tip, and it is therefore held rigidly in place by the retaining-clips. As is well known, by means of a three-point contact it is possible to secure a firm support for irregular shapes of all kinds, and by this means, no matter how irregularly the blade may have been ground, it is supported firmly upon the blade-support and by means of the fastening devices clamped securely in that position. It will be readily understood that other means may be devised for providing a blade-support which will receive and hold firmly thereon blades of varying bevel or pitch and that the blade-support may be supplied with three points of contact for the blade in many other ways than the specific one shown, and I do not limit myself as to this. It is furthermore obvious that many other modifications and changes may be made without departing from the spirit of my invention, and I do not limit myself to the particular forms shown and described.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-.  \n  1.

Fig. 15 is a detailed view of a portion of the blade-support, hereinafter more particularly described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the drawings, 1 represents the conventional casing having the handle 2, and'to this casing is pivoted, as at 3, the blade-support 4:, provided with the usual guard-teeth 5. To the blade-support and at the ends and back thereof is pivoted the clip-frame 6, consisting of the arms 7 7, carrying the clips 8 and the cross-arm 9, having a slight elevation or projection 10 on its upper side at its middle portion. To the inner and rear face of the bladesupport is rigidly secured the yoke-shaped spring llt-for instance, by the rivets 12 12H and this spring serves the following purposes: The ends 13 13 normally press rearwardly against the lugs or shoulders 14L 14 on the clipframe, and thereby exert a constant tension serving to keep the clips down in contact with the top of the blade-support, as in Fig. 2. The head of the` yoke 15 bears against a lug 16 on the end of the lip or finger 17, which finger is pivoted to swing at the back of the blade-support, as will be readily understood from Fig. 5, and serves to hold the lip in either of two 'positions -tirst, when swung forward to bear against the back of the blade, and, second, when swung back for the insertion of the blade, as shown vin Fig. 6. The projecting tongue 18 of this spring has a small projection 19 struck from its surface, which is adapted to engage arecess 20 in the casing, and this acts as a catch which secures the blade-support to the casing and which can be readily operated by the buttonk 21, secured to the spring. It is obvious that by pressing on this button the catch is not only released, but the blade-support is swung open by the same movement. It will likewise be readily -seen thatwhen the lip 17 is sw ung backward for the insertion of the blade it strikes the elevation '10 of the cross-arm 9 and forces it slightly downward, thereby raising the clips and permitting a ready insertion of the blade as far as the stops or studs 22, but no farther, as the clips are not raised high enough to permit the blade to be lifted or forcedover the said stops. Upon swinging the lip 17 forward the pressure on the cross arm @is removed and the clipsare forced downward on the face of the blade by means of the spring-arms 13, and the clips bearing against the back of the blade .hold it firmly in place against all movement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will thus be seen that a single spring not only governs the clips and the lip at the back of the blade, but operates the catch holding the blade-support to the casing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In razors with casings of this type wherein the proper position of the blade is determined by its edge abutting against fixed stops, such as 22, considerable danger exists of breaking the edge of the blade at these points, and this is particularly so where the blade is forced against the stops by a strong spring action, as in the device above described. To lessen this danger, I have produced a modified structure, which, while embodying the general features of my said casing, is provided with a sliding lip or finger for pressing the blade into place which has no tendency to force the blade forward suddenly, but which will hold it firmly when in place. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the drawings, 23 represents the sliding' lip having the upturned portion 24 for engagement with the back of the blade. It slides back and forth in a recess or cavity 25, formed in the top of the blade-support, and has a depending portion 26, moving between the prongs 27 of the bent arm of the spring 1l. These prongs normally press upward against the under surface of the recess within which the bladeholding lip moves, and thus forcing it against the under surface of the recess serve to hold the lip securely in any desired position. As in the first form of my invention,when moved back for the insertion of the blade the lip slides over and bears down upon the elevation l0 of the cross-arm '9, thereby depressing it and raising the clips for the insertion of the blade. After the blade is inserted the lip is pushed forward, thereby releasing the clips and permitting them to press down upon the blade,while the back of the ylip is moved up to engage against the back of the blade. The tension of the spring-arm 27 causes sufficient friction to retain the lip in the adjusted position and hold it firmly against movement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In making safety-razor blades the grinding is usually done by hand, and it is almost impossible to grind them uniformly, no two blades ever being of exactly the same bevel or pitch. It thus happens that very few blades will fit accurately upon any given casing, there often being some slight tipping because of the prominence of one supporting portion over another. This impairs the rigidity and firmness of the device, and in order to obviate this difficulty I have devisedv a structure wherein the blade-support is provided with three points of contact upon which the blade is held or supported when in position. These points of contact are the two front portions of the support just back of the studs 22.which support theends of the edge of the blade, and \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea third point of contact, which I have placed at the center near the back of the blade-support, utilizing the upper rounded face or surface 28 of the recess or box 25, which is raised slightly higher than the sides of the rear of the blade-holder, as will be seen in dotted lines in Figs. 9 and 15. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In Fig. 15 a section of the upper face or surface 28 of the box 25 is shown and a p0rtion of a blade in contact therewith. It will readily be seen that the rear support for thel blade having no appreciable surface affords no opportunity for the blade to tip, and it is therefore held rigidly in place by the retaining-clips. As is well known, by means of a three-point contact it is possible to secure a firm support for irregular shapes of all kinds, and by this means, no matter how irregularly the blade may have been ground, it is supported firmly upon the blade-support and by means of the fastening devices clamped securely in that position. It will be readily understood that other means may be devised for providing a blade-support which will receive and hold firmly thereon blades of varying bevel or pitch and that the blade-support may be supplied with three points of contact for the blade in many other ways than the specific one shown, and I do not limit myself as to this. It is furthermore obvious that many other modifications and changes may be made without departing from the spirit of my invention, and I do not limit myself to the particular forms shown and described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

SHUE, AOF DENVER, COLORADO.  \n EXPNSIBLE PULLEY.  \n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 769,117, dated August 30, 1904.  \n Application filed November 9,1903. Serial NO- 180,333- (NO DlOdel- To all \u0026#39;wh/0m, t may concern:  \n  Beit known that I, PHILIP H. SHUE, a citizen of the United States, residing at Denver, in the county of Arapahoe and State of Colorado, have invented new and useful Improvements in Expansible Pulleys, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention relates particularly to expansible pulleys in which the expansion of rimsegments is produced by the use of disks having a spiral groove, and more particularly to improvements\u0026#39; in my Patent No. 718,800, issued January 20, 1903.  \n  The object of the invention is to improve the construction of such pulleys, especially with respect to the adj usting-rings, which control the movement of the segments, and consequently the size of the pulley. The construction herein shown has a friction-clutch permitting gradual starting and stopping of the adjusting-rings instead of the positive action as shown in said patent. Improvement is also shown and claimed with respect to the construction of the pulley-frame, permitting a greater degree of contraction.  \n  A further object isl to produce positive guides for the stems of the segments, so that they will remain in absolute alinement to prevent binding.  \n  \u0026#39;Various other improvements in details Vof. construction will be apparent from the followings.  \n In the drawings, Figure 1 1s a central sec- .tionof the pulley lengthwise of the` shaft.  \n Fig. 2 is a similar section\u0026#39;in a different plane. Fig. 3 is a half elevation and transverse sec-` tion, and Fig. 4C is a detail in perspective showing \u0026#39;oneof the bearing-blocks which is carried by a pin on the inner end of the stems of the rim segments and whichk llt in the grooves. l  \n \u0026#39; Referring specilically to the drawings, the main shaft is indicated at 6. The pulley-frame is formed of two split side sections 7 ,the hubs 8 of which meet at the middle of the pulley when the parts are assembled. Said hubs are extended outwardly, as at 9, to form a` bearing for the adj usting-rings 10 thereon. rlhese rings are split and the halves joined together in any suitable manner, and each has on the inner face thereof a spiral or Worm gear 10E. Springs 11, in compression between the hub of the rings-and the flange 9, tend to keep the rings in gear with the pinion 12, the shaft 12 of which linds its bearings on the frame 7 and carries at its outer endI a bevel-gear 111, in mesh with a corresponding gear 14, the shaft 15l of which extends through bearings in the side plate of the pulley and carries a pinion 15, meshing with an internal gear 16, produced in the rim of the adjusting-disks 17. These disks are split, as indicated in my former patent, and have on the inner faces thereofspiral grooves 171. The disks 17 are rotatable on the hub of the frame, and the hubs of the disks meet at the middle line of the pulley and are joined -by welltting dowel-pins 17h. The hub of the main frame is cored Alengthwise to receive a spacing-rod 18, which extends between the hubs of the adjusting rings, and has for its purpose to space the adjusting-rings apart, so that they move simultaneously, and when one is in full gear with its pinion 12 the other is out of gear, and  \n the springs 11 are balanced, so that normally both adjusting-rings are in gear with the pinions and any action thereof is counteracted.  \n To the rim of each of the side sections 7 an a segmental bearing-block 22h, the surfaces of which are properly curved to conform closely to the sides of the groove. The purpose of this is to avoid any looseness or play of the segments. The blocks 22b are loosely litted on the pins, so that they conform without binding friction to the\u0026#39;grooves. They also serve to give amore lirm support to the seg` ments to resist the radial thrust thereon.  \n For the purpose of positively guiding the IOO stems and keeping them in exact radial alinement spacing-plates 23 are provided. rIhese plates are fitted between the rims of the frames 7 and have lugs 23a on the sides which it into depressions communicating with the tapped holes for the cap-screws 20, so that when the screws are tightened their points bear against the lugs and assist in holding the plates in position. Each plate has a hole at the middle through which the ste-m 22 works at a close flt. This keeps the stem in alinement and prevents any distortion or binding incident to the tangential pull on the segments. To further assist in holding the plates 23 in position and to guide the stems, inner segmental guides 24 are employed. Each of these consists of a casting having end surfaces 24, between which are spaces disposed in radial alinement with respect to the wheel. The said surfaces are in guiding contact with the stems 22. These pieces are fastened to the plates 23 by screws, as at 24h, and are located between the\u0026#39; adjusting-disks 17. It will be seen that in connection with said plates they make a complete ring around the pulley of suiiicient body and strength to support the tangential strain and to form rigid guides for the radial movement of the stems. rI he levers to shift the adjusting-ring are shown at 25 suitably bowed over the shaft and pivoted at some fixed point in a manner common to this class of levers. Each carries clamps .26 and 27, the latter of which is controlled by a hand-latch 28 to throw the clamp into or out of engagement with the rim of the adjustingrings 10.  \n  In operation the springs 11 keep both adjusting-rings partially in contact with the shifting gear, and thereby the pulley must remain constant, as one side opposes the other, and the pulley cannot fcrawl or shift itself in the slightest. To change the diameter of y the pulley, the lever 25 is pressed against the rim of the ring, which throws the gear of the ring in full engagement with the pinion 12, and by means of the spacing-rod 18 the adjusting-ring on the other side is thrown out of gear. The clamp is then applied to the rim of the adjusting-ring by means of the hand-latch, eifecting a friction-clutch which gradually stops the movement thereof. The continued revolution of the pulley causes the rotation of the pinion 12 by its engagement in the worm-gear 10 and accordingly turns the adjusting-disks 17, which draws the pulley-segments in or out, according to the direction of rotation.  \n  The above description indicates the preferable embodiment in a split pulley; but it is obvious that the same invention may be used in connection with a solid pulley, and the scope of the invention is not limited to the specific construction set forth, nor otherwise than is indicated in the following claims.  \n  vWhat I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-  \n  1. The combination with a pulley-frame having radially guided movable rim segments, of oppositely-operating expansion devices on each side of the frame, and a connection between said devices constructed to disvspacing-rod extending between the rings and through the pulley.  \n  4. The combination with a pulley having an expansible segmental rim, of adjustingrings on opposite sides of the hub of the pulley and geared to the segments, springs bearing against the rings and tending to keep both in partial gear, and a rod extending through the hub between the rings, spacing the same apart, so that when one is thrown in full gear the other is thrown out of gear.  \n  5. The combination with the frame, andthe spirally-grooved expansion-disks therein, of the rim-segments having stems extending between the disks,the radial guides on the frame for the stems and the movable bearing-blocks carried by the stem, in the grooves.  \n  6. The combination with the frame, and the spirally grooved expansion-disks therein, of the radially movable rim segments having stems with projections engaging the grooves, and guides for the stems, supported on the frame.  \n  7. The combination with the frame, and the spirally-grooved expansion-disks therein, of the radially movable rim segments having stems with projections engaging the grooves, and the segments fixed to the frame, between the stems and having radial guides therefor.  \n  In testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence of two suhscribing witnesses.  \n PHILIP H.

Serial NO- 180,333- (NO DlOdel- To all 'wh/0m, t may concern: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Beit known that I, PHILIP H. SHUE, a citizen of the United States, residing at Denver, in the county of Arapahoe and State of Colorado, have invented new and useful Improvements in Expansible Pulleys, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates particularly to expansible pulleys in which the expansion of rimsegments is produced by the use of disks having a spiral groove, and more particularly to improvements' in my Patent No. 718,800, issued January 20, 1903. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The object of the invention is to improve the construction of such pulleys, especially with respect to the adj usting-rings, which control the movement of the segments, and consequently the size of the pulley. The construction herein shown has a friction-clutch permitting gradual starting and stopping of the adjusting-rings instead of the positive action as shown in said patent. Improvement is also shown and claimed with respect to the construction of the pulley-frame, permitting a greater degree of contraction. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A further object isl to produce positive guides for the stems of the segments, so that they will remain in absolute alinement to prevent binding. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 'Various other improvements in details Vof. construction will be apparent from the followings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the drawings, Figure 1 1s a central sec- .tionof the pulley lengthwise of the` shaft. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFig. 2 is a similar section'in a different plane. Fig. 3 is a half elevation and transverse sec-` tion, and Fig. 4C is a detail in perspective showing 'oneof the bearing-blocks which is carried by a pin on the inner end of the stems of the rim segments and whichk llt in the grooves. l \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e' Referring specilically to the drawings, the main shaft is indicated at 6. The pulley-frame is formed of two split side sections 7 ,the hubs 8 of which meet at the middle of the pulley when the parts are assembled. Said hubs are extended outwardly, as at 9, to form a` bearing for the adj usting-rings 10 thereon. rlhese rings are split and the halves joined together in any suitable manner, and each has on the inner face thereof a spiral or Worm gear 10E. Springs 11, in compression between the hub of the rings-and the flange 9, tend to keep the rings in gear with the pinion 12, the shaft 12 of which linds its bearings on the frame 7 and carries at its outer endI a bevel-gear 111, in mesh with a corresponding gear 14, the shaft 15l of which extends through bearings in the side plate of the pulley and carries a pinion 15, meshing with an internal gear 16, produced in the rim of the adjusting-disks 17. These disks are split, as indicated in my former patent, and have on the inner faces thereofspiral grooves 171. The disks 17 are rotatable on the hub of the frame, and the hubs of the disks meet at the middle line of the pulley and are joined -by welltting dowel-pins 17h. The hub of the main frame is cored Alengthwise to receive a spacing-rod 18, which extends between the hubs of the adjusting rings, and has for its purpose to space the adjusting-rings apart, so that they move simultaneously, and when one is in full gear with its pinion 12 the other is out of gear, and \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe springs 11 are balanced, so that normally both adjusting-rings are in gear with the pinions and any action thereof is counteracted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the rim of each of the side sections 7 an a segmental bearing-block 22h, the surfaces of which are properly curved to conform closely to the sides of the groove. The purpose of this is to avoid any looseness or play of the segments. The blocks 22b are loosely litted on the pins, so that they conform without binding friction to the'grooves. They also serve to give amore lirm support to the seg` ments to resist the radial thrust thereon. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purpose of positively guiding the IOO stems and keeping them in exact radial alinement spacing-plates 23 are provided. rIhese plates are fitted between the rims of the frames 7 and have lugs 23a on the sides which it into depressions communicating with the tapped holes for the cap-screws 20, so that when the screws are tightened their points bear against the lugs and assist in holding the plates in position. Each plate has a hole at the middle through which the ste-m 22 works at a close flt. This keeps the stem in alinement and prevents any distortion or binding incident to the tangential pull on the segments. To further assist in holding the plates 23 in position and to guide the stems, inner segmental guides 24 are employed. Each of these consists of a casting having end surfaces 24, between which are spaces disposed in radial alinement with respect to the wheel. The said surfaces are in guiding contact with the stems 22. These pieces are fastened to the plates 23 by screws, as at 24h, and are located between the' adjusting-disks 17. It will be seen that in connection with said plates they make a complete ring around the pulley of suiiicient body and strength to support the tangential strain and to form rigid guides for the radial movement of the stems. rI he levers to shift the adjusting-ring are shown at 25 suitably bowed over the shaft and pivoted at some fixed point in a manner common to this class of levers. Each carries clamps .26 and 27, the latter of which is controlled by a hand-latch 28 to throw the clamp into or out of engagement with the rim of the adjustingrings 10. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In operation the springs 11 keep both adjusting-rings partially in contact with the shifting gear, and thereby the pulley must remain constant, as one side opposes the other, and the pulley cannot fcrawl or shift itself in the slightest. To change the diameter of y the pulley, the lever 25 is pressed against the rim of the ring, which throws the gear of the ring in full engagement with the pinion 12, and by means of the spacing-rod 18 the adjusting-ring on the other side is thrown out of gear.

The continued revolution of the pulley causes the rotation of the pinion 12 by its engagement in the worm-gear 10 and accordingly turns the adjusting-disks 17, which draws the pulley-segments in or out, according to the direction of rotation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The above description indicates the preferable embodiment in a split pulley; but it is obvious that the same invention may be used in connection with a solid pulley, and the scope of the invention is not limited to the specific construction set forth, nor otherwise than is indicated in the following claims. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e vWhat I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

(No model.)  \n To all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, JOHN T. B. SLATER, a citizen of the United States, residing at Oleveland, in the county of Ouyahoga and State of Ohio, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Floor-Registers; and I do declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, which will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.  \n  My invention relates to improvements in floor-registers; and the invention consists in the construction, arrangement, and operation of parts, substantially as shown and described, and particularly pointed out in the claim.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a vertical sectional elevation of the complete register as it appears located in a floor. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the floor plate or grate which covers the same. Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the stationary outsidebox connected with the air-flue beneath; and Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the removable inside box, which is a separate part adapted to be set into the outer box and apart from the same, relatively as seen in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 represents certain details of the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 and hereinafter more specifically described.  \n  In the improvement as thus shown I have had in mind several distinct advantages, which will appear as the description progresses, and as among these I may enumerate the construction whereby the register can be removed and separated for cleansing and reassembled by an unskilled person, the construction which avoids downdrafts of cold air\u0026#39;and induces upward flow of the hot air, and the mechanism for easy operation, all as hereinafter more fully set forth.  \n  A represents an ordinary hot-air flue coming up from below and havingthe upper and outer box a connected therewith by baseflange a, and said box is provided with an outwardly-extending flange a at its top. The skirting or outside supporting-plate B for the register on the floor is provided with an inner depressed portion 5, upon which the flange a of the box a rests, and the grate or open work plate C is designed to come substantially flush with the top surface of plate B, so as to make an even surface to the floor.  \n  The inner removable box D is of a size adapted to be set on the right-angled baseshoulder a of the outer box a and is apart therefrom to leave an air-space between, relatively as shown, and said box D has rightangled flanges (Z at its top and holes therein for screws 0, which connect the grate O therewith, so that the box D and all that it carries are removable with the grate.  \n  The box D is of sheet-tin preferably and has ledges d struck up therein along its sides about midway its depth,which serve as closures at theedge of the register plates or vanes E. The said vanes are shown as having pivotholes 2 in the right-angled ends 3 and 4, respectively, by which they are supported on the pivot-pins g on the supporting plates or pieces G and G for said vanes. These plates have right-angled flanges 9\u0026#39; along their upper edges with holes for the screws 0, and the said flanges are clamped between the edges of inner box D and floor-plate O, and hence are lifted out with them when said parts are removed. Once being out the screws 0 are removed, and the parts are separated and available for individual cleansing. This is deemed important from a sanitary point of view as well as on other accounts, and it will be observed that there are no other screws in the entire structure and no rivets or other connecting n\u0026#39;icans by which said parts are united, except the pins g and holes 2, as above noted. These could be reversed on said parts and serve the same purpose.  \n  For the operation of the vanes or plates E I provide each end flange 4 with an inclined slot 5, and this is engaged by a pin or lug 6 on a sliding actuating-bar H, running in a confining guideway or channel 71/ in the plate G. Said plate is of less length than plate G and is provided with a post or projection h, which stands up between two spaced stops or shoulders 7 on plate Or and is corrugated or rough ened at its top to be engaged by the foot to move said bar, and thereby open or close the register. This brings the actuating-point for the vanes through pins 6, working in slots 5, so far above their pivots 9 that a very easy leverage is afforded for operating the vanes. \\Vhen bar H is at one extremity of its possible movement, the vanes are open, and when at the other extreme they are closed.  \n  It will be observed that the walls of inner box D are perpendicular on all sides and that they set back from the entrance of pipe A below, so that it follows practically that the hot air from pipe A has afree and unobstructed passage-way upward through the register and there is no converging of side walls or other construction which will impede the travel of the hot air or promote the counter travel of cold air from above. v  \n  The vanes E overlap, as usual, and are axially rotatable, but have no connection with each other, except indirectly through plates G and G and bar H.  \n What I claim is In hot-air registers, the outer box having an outwardly-extending flange in the upper portion thereof, a grate overlapping the top portion of the outer box, an inner box provided with right-angular flanges having apertures therein and having integral projections formed on the interior thereof, means passing through the apertures and the grate .to reniovably secure said inner box to the grate, a vane-support having an outwardly-extending flange at its upper portion interposed between the grate and the edge of the inner box, and provided with shoulders forming a channel thereon, said vane-support being adapted to rest on the projections of the inner box, pins formed upon said support, a slidable member provided with pins mounted in the channel of the support having an upwardly-extending projection, and vanes adapted to engage with the interior projections of the inner box having right-angularly-disposed integral projections formed on their ends provided with pivot-holes and angularly-disposed slots adapted to receive the pins of the.vanesupport and the pins of the sliding member, substantially as described.  \n  In testimony\u0026#39;whereof I sign this specification in the presence of two witnesses.  \n  JOHN T.

These plates have right-angled flanges 9' along their upper edges with holes for the screws 0, and the said flanges are clamped between the edges of inner box D and floor-plate O, and hence are lifted out with them when said parts are removed. Once being out the screws 0 are removed, and the parts are separated and available for individual cleansing. This is deemed important from a sanitary point of view as well as on other accounts, and it will be observed that there are no other screws in the entire structure and no rivets or other connecting n'icans by which said parts are united, except the pins g and holes 2, as above noted. These could be reversed on said parts and serve the same purpose. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e For the operation of the vanes or plates E I provide each end flange 4 with an inclined slot 5, and this is engaged by a pin or lug 6 on a sliding actuating-bar H, running in a confining guideway or channel 71/ in the plate G. Said plate is of less length than plate G and is provided with a post or projection h, which stands up between two spaced stops or shoulders 7 on plate Or and is corrugated or rough ened at its top to be engaged by the foot to move said bar, and thereby open or close the register. This brings the actuating-point for the vanes through pins 6, working in slots 5, so far above their pivots 9 that a very easy leverage is afforded for operating the vanes. \\Vhen bar H is at one extremity of its possible movement, the vanes are open, and when at the other extreme they are closed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be observed that the walls of inner box D are perpendicular on all sides and that they set back from the entrance of pipe A below, so that it follows practically that the hot air from pipe A has afree and unobstructed passage-way upward through the register and there is no converging of side walls or other construction which will impede the travel of the hot air or promote the counter travel of cold air from above. v \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The vanes E overlap, as usual, and are axially rotatable, but have no connection with each other, except indirectly through plates G and G and bar H. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I claim is In hot-air registers, the outer box having an outwardly-extending flange in the upper portion thereof, a grate overlapping the top portion of the outer box, an inner box provided with right-angular flanges having apertures therein and having integral projections formed on the interior thereof, means passing through the apertures and the grate .to reniovably secure said inner box to the grate, a vane-support having an outwardly-extending flange at its upper portion interposed between the grate and the edge of the inner box, and provided with shoulders forming a channel thereon, said vane-support being adapted to rest on the projections of the inner box, pins formed upon said support, a slidable member provided with pins mounted in the channel of the support having an upwardly-extending projection, and vanes adapted to engage with the interior projections of the inner box having right-angularly-disposed integral projections formed on their ends provided with pivot-holes and angularly-disposed slots adapted to receive the pins of the.vanesupport and the pins of the sliding member, substantially as described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In testimony'whereof I sign this specification in the presence of two witnesses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e JOHN T.

Serial No. 212,165. (No model.)  \n  a citizen of the United States, residing at Wilmington, county of Newcastle, Delaware, have invented a certain new and useful Improvement in Underframes for Passenger-Cars, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description, such as will enableothe\u0026#39;rs skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a portion of my improved underframe. \u0026#39;Fig. 2 is a side elevational view of the same. tional view on line 3 3, Fig. 1. Fig. i is a sectional. view on line 4 4:, Fig. 1; and Fig. 5 is a longitudinal sectional view through one of the bolster elements.  \n This invention relates to a new and usefulimprovement in underframes for passengercars, the object being to construct an underframe in such a manner as to take advantage of a cantaliver-support for the longitudinal sills at the ends of the car, whereby said longitudinal sills, which are preferably of wood, and their connected members will not be affected by contraction or expansion of the metallic members.  \n  Heretofore it has been proposed to construct passenger-cars with a steel underframing, the longitudinal angles or channels thereof extending from end to end of the car. In a car seventy feet long the unequal expansion of steel and wood under the ordinary range of temperatures is about from one-half to one inchthat is to say, the steel framing will expand under an ordinary high temperature one inch more than the wood, with the result that the interior\u0026#39;wooden finish is damaged by reason of the joints opening.  \n  It is the object of my present invention to avoid the objections resulting from this unequal expansion and still retain the benefits of a steel substructure, with the further advantage of the cantaliver construction at the ends of the car, the steel substructure being free Fig. 3 is a sec-- to expand from the bolster-support inwardly without affecting the wooden longitudinals and their connected parts.  \n  With the above object in view my invention consists in the novel construction, arrangement, and combination of the several parts, all as will hereinafter be described and afterward pointed out in the claims.  \n  In the drawings is shown a steel underframe designed for use under one end of a passenger-car; but it is obvious that in the actual construction of cars there will be two of these underframes, one for each end of the car.  \n  1 indicates what I will term the central members, and 2 the side members,said members being practically complementary to the center and side longitudinals of the wooden frame of the car. These members 1 and 2 are preferably made of vertically-disposed plates, deepest at the bolster-point and tapering thence toward the end and center of the car. Along the upper edges of these plates are angles 3, while the lower-edges are provided with angles 4, following the\u0026#39;contour of the lower edges of the plates. It is obvious that by this construction each longitudinal member of the end underframing constitutes in itself a plate-girder structure in which the top angle 3 is the tension-flange and the bottom angle 4 the compression-flange. It is also obvious that instead of having separate angles the longitudinal members can be made of pressed steel inwhich the tension and compression flanges will be integral with the vertical webs of the plate-girders. It will furthermorebe obvious that the bolster-support being located between the ends ofthese longitudinals will insure a cantaliver construction.  \n  5 indicates angles or flanges secured to the vertical webs of the longitudinals for supporting the wooden longitudinals 6 of the car. These flanges or angles 5 are preferably arranged so as to project in an opposite direction from the flanges 3 and 4, and in this way in addition to serving as a supporting-shelf for the wooden longitudinals the angles or flanges 5 also serve as lateral stiffeners for the vertical webs of the longitudinal members of the underframe and materially add to their rigidity, said flanges or angles 5 resisting the buffing and pulling stresses as well as the tendency of the vertical webs to buckle under strain.  \n  7 indicates the end sill of the car, which is preferably in the form of a channel with its flanges presented outwardly, the flanges of said channel being riveted to top and bottom cover-plates 8 and 9, respectively, which cover-plates are in turn riveted to the ends of the angles or flanges 3 and 1. If desired, diagonals 10 may be riveted to the top coverplate 8 and to one of the top bolster coverplates.  \n  11 indicates the bolster-webs, which are preferably in the form of vertically-disposed plates interrupted for the passage of the central members 1. I do not wish, however, to be understood as being limited to the use of an interrupted bolster, as it is well known that a bolster having a continuous web could be employed, in which event the central members 1 would be interrupted. These bolsterwebs, as shown in Fig. 3, are reinforced at the upper and lower edges by angles 12 and 13. Suitable connection-plates may be employed for rigidly attaching the bolster-webs to the center and side members of the underframe in a well-known manner, as is obvious. Filler-blocks 14 may also be employed between the central members, and in addition top and bottom cover-plates 15 and 16 may also be used for well-understood purposes.  \n 17 indicates bridge-pieces extending across the ends of the bolsters at their under side for y the purpose of affording or supporting the side bearing.  \n  18 indicates a plate through which the kingbolt passes, and this plate is duplicated, preferably, on the under side of the central members; but instead of plates it is obvious that malleable castings forming filler-blocks can be employed. I have not shown the center plate of the car, but will say that said center plate is wide enough to take in both center members.  \n  19 indicates the platform members, which are preferably arranged under the end-sill cover-plate 9 andare supported in position by a truss-shaped carrying-plate 20. So far as the platform is concerned it may be of any approved construction.  \n  21 indicates a needle-beam, which is preferably in the form of a bulb-angle extending from side to side of the car, said angle carrying the queen or king post 22. The ends of the longitudinals land 2 rest upon the needlebeam and preferably terminate at said needlebeam, although they may project inwardly beyond the needle-beam, if desired.  \n  23 indicates the truss-rods, one of said trussrods being preferably arranged under each longitudinal member of my underframe, said truss-rods being secured to the lower (or upper) cover-plate of the\u0026#39;bolster, as desired, and  \n ster, where they are secured by bolts or other\u0026#39; fastening means to the vertical webs of the longitudinal members of the underframe. If desired, other fastening means may be employed for securing the wooden longitudinals to the inner ends of the longitudinal members of the underframe; but in the event such fastening is used it may be necessary to elongate the\u0026#39;openings in either the wooden or metallic longitudinals to permit of independent expansion of the parts. From the bolster outwardly separate wooden longitudinals are secured in position by suitable bolts to the metallic longitudinal members; but as this distance is shortusually about ten feet the difference in expansion between these members is inappreciable. The distance between the king-pins being about fifty feet, it will readily beseen that if the wooden longitudi-- nals are secured only at their ends to the underframing the portions of the metallic underframing extending beyond the point of attachment of the wooden longitudinals are free to independently expand and contract without in any way afiecting or disturbing the connection between the wooden longitudinals and the underframing at points approximately in the transverse plane of the bolsters.  \n  I am aware that many minor changes in the arrangement, construction, and combination of the several parts of my underframing may be made and substituted for those herein shown and described without in the least departing from the nature and principle of my invention.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. In a car, the combination with wooden longitudinals, of metallic underframes arranged under each end of the car, said underframes being free to independently expand and contract between the bolsters; substantially as described.  \n  2. In a car, the combination with wooden longitudinals, of metallic underframes under each end of the car and connected to said wooden longitudinals only at points approximately in the transverse planes of the bolsters; substantially as described.  \n  3. In a car, the combination with wooden longitudinals, of metallic cantaliver-underframes under each end of the car; substantially as described.  \n  4. In a car, the combination with wooden longitudinals, of a cantaliver-underframe, a  \n  approximately in the transverse plane of the bolster, forming a cantaliver construction; substantially as described.  \n  7. In a car, the combination of a bolster, plate-girder longitudinal, members having top and bottom flanges and forming a cantaliver construction, and supporting means carried by said longitudinal members for cooperating with the Wooden longitudinal members of the car; substantially as described.  \n  8. The combination of an end sill and a bolster, longitudinal members connected to said parts and provided with top and bottom flanges, a needle-beam under the inner ends of said longitudinal members, and a supportingangle secured to said longitudinal members along their intermediate portions, said angle being flush With the top of said needle-beam; substantially as described.  \n  9. In a car, the combination with Wooden longitudinals, of an underframe arranged under the end of said car and carrying platform members at its outer end, a needle-beam for supporting the inner ends of the longitudinal members of said underframe, said longitudinal members being deepest in the transverse plane of the bolster, a bolster, top and bottom cover-plates for said bolster, truss-rods, and angles secured to the longitudinal members of the underframe for supporting the Wooden longitudinals of the car; substantially as described.  \n  In testimony whereof I hereunto arfix my signature, in the presence of tWo Witnesses, this 7th day of June, 1904.  \n CHARLES S.

Application filed February 26, 1903. Serial No. 145,158. (No model.)  \n T0 all whom it may concern:  \n Be it known that I, ALFRED EMILE EDMOND BREARD, banker, a citizen of the Republic of France, and a resident\u0026#39;of 19 Boulevard Waleslierbet, Paris,-France, have invented a new and succession of objects, such as kinematographicl views having a continuous movement, and for obtaining also dissolving images, I have conceived the plan of displacing certain of the lenses composing the objective, while keeping them parallel with each other, by causingV them to move around two axes situated equidistantly from the optical axis of the fixed part of the objective parallel to this axis and in the same plane therewith.  \n  In the accompanying drawings. Figures l, 2, 3. 4, and 5 are diagrams, which will behereinafter explained, illustrating the principle of my invention. Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate an operative strdcture embodying the invention, Fig. 6 representing a vertical section in a plane passing through the optical axis of the apparatus, and Fig. 7 an elevation as viewed from the left of Fig. 6.  \n  Referring first to the diagrams Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, consider an objective placed between an object a b and its image a b received on a screen c, Fig. l, such objective being composed of fixed lenses d e and movable Y lenses f g g, the focal length of the combined lenses g g being equal to the focal length of the lens f. If f revolves about the axis Fig. 2. and if g g revolve together in the opposite direction around the axis y, each system describing the same circular arc, lthe image a\u0026#39; b\u0026#39;, Fig\u0026#39;. 1, will be correspondingly displaced on the screen. The displacement thus obtained will evidently be the resultant of the displacements produced by each of the revolving-lens systems considered separately. Now one of the systems taken by itself would produce on the screen a displacement in the arc of a circle and the other a displacement equally in the arc of a circle, but in the opposite sense. These two circular arcs have a single point in common when all the lenses of the objective have a common optical axis. They are then touching. They have the same radius, as being the deviation of a luminous ray by movable systems having the same focal length turning around two centers equidistant from the optical center. Finally, they are equal when the rotations of the lenses which have produced them are themselves equal. The resultant of the combined action of the two systems will then be a straight line z a\u0026#39;, Fig. 3-\u0026#39;-that is to say, the rays will be deviated vertically without suering any lateral deviation.  \n  It will be understood that if the object the image of which is projected on the screen by the objective is displaced in a line perpendicular to the plane of the axes m and g/ of the systems of revolving lenses it is possible to keep the image stationary by observing the sole condition thatthe speed of revolution of the lenses f and g g should be suitably regulated-that is to say, it ought to take the same time for one image and one sector to Ypass wholly by the optical axis, and if instead of a single object it is desired to project the images of a series of objects-such as kinematograph views, for exampleHit is sufficient that a series of lenses should be arranged around the axes\u0026#39;y so as to make complete wheels, Fig. 4, in order to obtain the projection of the images of the objects at a fixed point on the screen.  \n  It will be observed that the arrangement described above has the advantage of having a continuous movement. It has, moreover, the advantage that dissolving views are obtained as one view passes into the other, provided that for the revolving systems there are used lenses f g g\u0026#39; of smaller diameter than that of the fixed lenses d e in such a manner that each sector of the revolving lenses corresponds with a View, while the fixed system is of sufiicient dimensions to combine the effect f and ff are fixed together upon a second of several revolving sectors at the same time. In this way the images are superimposed on the screen, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 5, each increasing oi` diminishing\u0026#39; in brilliancy in proportion as it approaches or recedes from the optical axis of the fixed system, and consequently each image is successively viewed with the maximum brilliancy by the spectator at the moment when the object which produces it passes the level of this axis.  \n  It is obvious that instead of projecting` the images on a screen they may be regarded directly through an eyepiece. Moreover, the number of the movable lenses and that of the fixed lenses may evidently be varied, the duplication of one of the systems of movable lenses consisting of two lenses g g\u0026#39;, placed one on each side of the lens f, which consti tutes the other movable system, is only to correct the effects of the difference in position of the two movable systems from that of the fixed system.  \n  The film or transparent band j, carrying the images,advances with a continuous movement, being driven by teeth or points or projections on the two extremities of the roller which points enter into holes pierced in the edges of the band. rl`his latter is guided by rollers 73. The drum Z has the diameter desired for displacing the band j the length of twelve images, during which the wheels or rotary carriers f ffy g make one revolution, and as each of these wheels is furnished with twelve lenses it may bc seen that a new lens acts for each image. rl`he advancing movement of the film j and the rotative movement of the wheels furnished with lenses are given by a crank c and spiral gear-wheels t a and b 7). The band passes between fixed guides c. The wheel g is fixed upon a shaft, and the wheels shaft parallel with the first and situated like it at the height of the optical axis of the apparatus. lf one of these elements f f/ is thus divided into two, fj, it is for the purpose of avoiding deformation of the defective images,  \n owing to which the lens of the wheel f being in front of the lens of the wheel g those of f are, on the contrary, behind it.  \n  /L and c\u0026#39; are the compound objectives such as are Well known. In this example there is one objective in front of the lens-wheels and one in rear thereof; but this is not indispensable. There should be at least one to bring back into the axis of the apparatus the rays which have traversed the wheels, the latter not being in the axis, but to the right and left of it, respectively.  \n  Z is the condenser with which the illuminating-lantern is furnished toparallelize the luminous rays. fm. m and a a are supports.  \n Vhat I claim as my invention is 1. An objective for kinematographic and like projection composed of fixed lenses, two systems of revolving lenses, two rotary carriers for said revolving lenses and means for producing the rotary movement of said carriers in opposite directions, said revolving lenses being arranged in circles around the axes of their respective carriers and the axes of the carriers being parallel with and equidistant from the optical axis of the fixed lenses while the three axes are in the same plane and the optical axis of the several lenses is perpendicular to the direction of the movement of the objects the images of which are to be projected by the objective, substantially as herein described.  \n  2. An objective composed of fixed lenses and two systems of revolving lenses having their optical axes and their axes of revolution equidistant from and parallel with the optical axis of the fixed lenses, one of said systems of revolving lenses being divided into two parts, one of said parts being arranged in front and the other behind the other` of said systems, substantially as herein described.  \n  1n testimony that I claim the foregoing as my invention l have signed my name, in presence of two witnesses, this 14th day of February, 1903.  \n ALFRED EMILE EDMOND BRERD.  \n Vitnesses:  \n J.

Serial IIO- 184,873. No modelh To aZZ whom, it may concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, LEWIS F. RAMSEY, acitizen of the United States, residing at Kansas City, in the county of Jackson and State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Shoe Lace or Strap Fasteners, of which the following is a specification.  \n  My invention relates to improvements in lace or strap fasteners.  \n  The object of my invention is to provide a device by which the end of a shoe lace or strap may be quickly and securely fastened and from which the lace or strap may as readily be released.  \n  My invention consists in certain novel features of construction, which are hereinafter fully described and claimed,  \n  In the accompanying drawings, illustrative of my invention, Figure l represents a front elevation view of the upper part of a\u0026#39;shoe to which is secured a lace-fastener of my invention. Fig. 2 is a plan View of the fastener, the cylindrical portion of the base being shown in horizontal section and the corruthe shoe-leather and the ends bent parallel with the body, so as to clench the leather. At one end of the plate 1 is formed a transverse hollow cylindrical portion 3, in whichis preferably rotatively mounted one end of the member 4, comprising, preferably, a resilient wire having a plurality of transverse corrugations 5, over and underwhich the lace or strap 6 is interwoven. The other end of the plate 1 is provided at one side edge with a 11p 7, which extends at substantially right angles to the plate on its upper or outer side,  \n the end of said lip being turned over the plate, so as to receive thereunder the free end of the member 4 when the said member is swung to a position substantially parallel with the plate 1. For convenience in releasing the member 4 from or engaging it with the lip 7 the free end of the member 4 may be provided with a head 8, preferably formed by bending the end of the member 4 back upon itself. When the device is to be used as a fastener for a shoe-lace, the member 4 has the corrugations 5 made in the form of a series of connected undulations disposed in a plane parallel with the plate 1 when the device is in the closed position. I/Vhen to be used as a strap-fastener, the corrugations of the member 4 of the device are formed as shown in Fig. 3, the transverse portions of the corrugated member being disposed at right angles to the length of the plate 1.  \n  In operating the invention the base-plate is secured in any suitable manner to the shoe or other support and the member 4 swung to the position shown in Fig. 4. The lace 6 is then inserted under the first transverse portion of the corrugated part, thence over the next transverse portion, and thence under the next corrugated portion. The member 4 is then swung over and substantially parallel with the plate 1, the free end of the member 4 being forced under the lip 7, thus securely clamping the lace 6 between the two members. By interweaving the lace 6 in and out of the corrugations 5 the lace is made to assume an undulatory form, in which form it will be securely held against lengthwise movement. To release the lace,it is but necessary to free the member 4 from the lip 7 by springing the member 4to the-positionshown in dotted lines in Fig. 2, from which position it can be swung to the position shown in Fig. 4, and then the lace may be quickly disengaged from the corrugations. The device is similarly operated when it is used to fasten the end of a strap.  \n  To retain the member 4 in the cylindrical portion 3 of the .plate 1, any suitable means may be employed. In the drawings I have shown a portion of the inner side of one end of the cylindrical portion cut away Where the Wire 4 emerges from the cylindrical portion, and opposite this cut-away portion is upwardly extended opposite the central hole of the cylindrical portion a projection 9, which permits the free swinging of the member 4:, but prevents its slipping out of the cylindrical portion of the plate 1.  \n  My invention may be variously modified Without departing from the spirit thereof.  \n  Having thus described my invention, What I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  The combination With a base-plate having at one end a lip and at the other end a transverse tubular portion, a projection opposite In testimony whereof I afiix my signature in 2 5 presence of two witnesses.  \n  LEWIS F.

RAMSEY, acitizen of the United States, residing at Kansas City, in the county of Jackson and State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Shoe Lace or Strap Fasteners, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention relates to improvements in lace or strap fasteners. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The object of my invention is to provide a device by which the end of a shoe lace or strap may be quickly and securely fastened and from which the lace or strap may as readily be released. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention consists in certain novel features of construction, which are hereinafter fully described and claimed, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the accompanying drawings, illustrative of my invention, Figure l represents a front elevation view of the upper part of a'shoe to which is secured a lace-fastener of my invention. Fig. 2 is a plan View of the fastener, the cylindrical portion of the base being shown in horizontal section and the corruthe shoe-leather and the ends bent parallel with the body, so as to clench the leather. At one end of the plate 1 is formed a transverse hollow cylindrical portion 3, in whichis preferably rotatively mounted one end of the member 4, comprising, preferably, a resilient wire having a plurality of transverse corrugations 5, over and underwhich the lace or strap 6 is interwoven. The other end of the plate 1 is provided at one side edge with a 11p 7, which extends at substantially right angles to the plate on its upper or outer side, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe end of said lip being turned over the plate, so as to receive thereunder the free end of the member 4 when the said member is swung to a position substantially parallel with the plate 1. For convenience in releasing the member 4 from or engaging it with the lip 7 the free end of the member 4 may be provided with a head 8, preferably formed by bending the end of the member 4 back upon itself. When the device is to be used as a fastener for a shoe-lace, the member 4 has the corrugations 5 made in the form of a series of connected undulations disposed in a plane parallel with the plate 1 when the device is in the closed position. I/Vhen to be used as a strap-fastener, the corrugations of the member 4 of the device are formed as shown in Fig. 3, the transverse portions of the corrugated member being disposed at right angles to the length of the plate 1. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In operating the invention the base-plate is secured in any suitable manner to the shoe or other support and the member 4 swung to the position shown in Fig. 4. The lace 6 is then inserted under the first transverse portion of the corrugated part, thence over the next transverse portion, and thence under the next corrugated portion. The member 4 is then swung over and substantially parallel with the plate 1, the free end of the member 4 being forced under the lip 7, thus securely clamping the lace 6 between the two members. By interweaving the lace 6 in and out of the corrugations 5 the lace is made to assume an undulatory form, in which form it will be securely held against lengthwise movement. To release the lace,it is but necessary to free the member 4 from the lip 7 by springing the member 4to the-positionshown in dotted lines in Fig. 2, from which position it can be swung to the position shown in Fig. 4, and then the lace may be quickly disengaged from the corrugations. The device is similarly operated when it is used to fasten the end of a strap. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To retain the member 4 in the cylindrical portion 3 of the .plate 1, any suitable means may be employed. In the drawings I have shown a portion of the inner side of one end of the cylindrical portion cut away Where the Wire 4 emerges from the cylindrical portion, and opposite this cut-away portion is upwardly extended opposite the central hole of the cylindrical portion a projection 9, which permits the free swinging of the member 4:, but prevents its slipping out of the cylindrical portion of the plate 1. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention may be variously modified Without departing from the spirit thereof. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus described my invention, What I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The combination With a base-plate having at one end a lip and at the other end a transverse tubular portion, a projection opposite In testimony whereof I afiix my signature in 2 5 presence of two witnesses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e LEWIS F.

Serial No. 216,632. (No model.)  \n To all whom, it 717,001 concern:  \n  Be it known that I, OMAR BENSON, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of New Bedford, county of Bristol, State of Massachusetts, have invented an Improvement in Adjustable Back-Stops for Picker-Sticks, of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specification, like characters on the drawings repre senting like parts.  \n  This invention has for its object the production of a novel back-stop adapted to cooperate with and stop the outward stroke of the pickerstick of a loom, means being provided whereby the back-stop may be adjusted to take up wear and to regulate the point at which the picker-stick is to be stopped.  \n  The various novel features of my invention will be fully described in the subjoined specification and particularly pointed out in the following claims.  \n  Figure 1 is a top-or plan view of one end of the lay of a loom with one embodiment of my invention applied thereto. Fig. 2 is an end elevation thereof. Fig. 3 is an enlarged plan view of the back-stop detached, and Fig. 4 is an enlarged perspective view thereof.  \n  The lay 1, having a longitudinal slot 2, in which the picker-stick 3 swings inward and outward, the shuttle-box, comprising a front plate 1, top or cover plate 5, back plate 6, and binder 7, may be and are all of well-known or usual construction.  \n  Ordinarily a leather loop is passed around the end of the lay and through the outer end of the slot 9. to form a back-stop for the pickerstick on its outward stroke, such leather loop wearing rapidly and having no ZL\u0026#39;CljuSllIIH-Blll].  \n  In my present invention I mount on the lay in an adjustable manner a back-stop for the picker-stick, said back-stop preferably being made of metal, and by its adjustability the stopping-point of the picker-stick can be regulated with accuracy and wear taken up when. necessary.  \n  Referring to Figs. 3 and 1, 1 have shown a metallic stand 8, having an extension 9 of less thickness than the stand and considerably wider than the latter, the extension having an upturned sharpened prong 10 and a bolthole 11. The stand is applied to the bottom of the lay (see Figs. 1 and 2) in such position that the body portion 8 is at the outer end of and transverse to the slot 2, the prong 10 entering the lay-beam, while a bolt 12, passed downward through the lay and the hole 1.1 in the extension 9, receives a retaining-nut 13 beneath the extension, clamping the stand securely to the lay. The prong l0 obviates any tendency of the stand to twist or turn around the bolt 12.  \n  A threaded seat 14 (see dotted lines, Fig. 3) is formed in the body of the stand, passing therethrough from its inner to its outer face, and when the stand is clamped on the lay the seat is in alinement with the path of the picker stick 3.  \n  The back-stop is herein shown as an enlarged metallic head 15, formed on a threaded shank 16, the head having a convex impact face 17 and located at the inner side of the stand, the shank being screwed into the seat 1\u0026#39; 1.  \n  By turning the back-stop and its shank the back-stop can be adjusted toward or from the center of the loom to vary the stopping-point for the picker-stick on its outward stroke or to take up wear, and when adjusted a checknut 18 is set up on the outer end of the shank against the body of the stand, locking the backstop in adjusted position.  \n  If desired, the backstop may have a pol ygonal perimeter to facilitate adjustment by a wrench, and so,too,the outer end of the shank 16 may be nicked, as at 16 to receive the blade of a screi driver for a similar purpose.  \n  The device is simple, strong, and durable and readily adjusted when desired.  \n  Having fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. In a loom, a longitudinally-slotted lay, a picker-stick adapted to oscillate in the slot, a back-stop mounted on the lay at the outer end of the path of the picker-stick, and having a non-yielding convex face to receive the blow of the picker-stick, a stand rigidly secured to the lay and in which the hack-stop is adjustably held, and means to fixedly lock the backstop in adjusted position in the stand.  \n  2. In a loom, a longitudinally-slotted lay, a picker-stick adapted to oscillate in the slot, a stand mounted on the lay at the outer end of the slot therein and having a threaded seat in alinernent with the path of the picker-stick, a rigid metallic back-stop having a threaded shank to be screwed into the seat, and means to fixedly lock the shank of the back-stop in its seat.  \n  3.

Serial No. 50,0645. (No model.)  \n To al? \u0026#39;1c-hom, it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, WATSON M. HOLMES, a citizen of the United States, residing at Hoosick Falls, in the county of Rensselaer and State of New York, have invented new and useful Thrust-Bearing, of which the following is a specification.  \n This invention relates to thrust-bearings.  \n  The object of the invention is to provide means whereby the load imposed upon the bearing is taken by a body of oil, water, or other fluid. under pressure.`  \n  A further object of the invention is to provide means for maintaining a body of oil, water, or other fluid under pressure between the adjacent or juxtaposited surfaces of the thrustbearing.  \n  A further object of the invention is to provide means for efficiently lubricating\u0026#39; the parts of the bearing.  \n  Other objects of the invention will appear more fully hereinafter.  \n  The invention consists, substantially, in the construction, combination, location, and arrangement of parts, all as will be more fully hereinafter set forth, as shown in the accompanying drawings, and linally pointed Vout in the appended claims.  \n  Referring\u0026#39; to the accompanying\u0026#39; drawings and to the various views and reference-signs appearing thereon, Figure l is a longitudinal central section through a thrust-bearing construction embodying the principles of my invention. Fig. 2 is a transverse section on the line 2 2 of Fig. l looking in the direction of the arrows. Figs. 3 and 4 are detail views in transverse section.  \n  The same part is designated by the sam reference-sign wherever it occurs throughout the several views.  \n  In carrying out my invention I propose to maintain a body of oil, water, or other suitable fluid or liquid under pressure between the adjacent or juxtaposited faces or surfaces of the relatively moving parts of the thrustu bearing, whereby the load imposed upon the bearing when in operation is taken by the body of oil, water, or other liuid, thereby relieving such adjacent faces or surfaces of the, relatively moving parts of undue wear and friction. By employing a body of oil for this purpose I also provide means whereby the relatively moving parts are maintained in eflicient lubrication.  \n  In the drawings reference-signs B2 and O designate, respectively, relatively moving\u0026#39; parts of a thrust-bearing, and in carrying out my inventionv I deliver between the adjacent or juxtaposited surfaces of these relatively moving\u0026#39; parts oil, water, or other suitable liquid or fluid under pressure in such manner that the load imposed upon the bearing may be taken by the body of oil, water, or other medium employed. The delivery of the oil, water, or other medium and the pressure thereof may be effected in any suitable or convenient manner. In the particular form shown, to which, however, the invention is not limited, the oil, water, or other medium is delivered between the adjacent or juxtaposited surfaces of the relatively moving parts E C of the bearing\u0026#39; through the delivery-pipe fD of a pump D\u0026#39;,  \n . and, if desired, said pump may` be in communication wlth a tank or other source of supply E. In this manner and by this arrangement it will be seen that the oil, water, or the like may be delivered between the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts B\u0026#34;a O under any desired and constant pressure. In practice I propose to deliver the oil, water, or other medium between said relatively moving surfaces under a pressure somewhat exceeding\u0026#39; the amount of thrust or load which the bearing is intended to receive, thus and there by supporting\u0026#39; one of the relatively moving parts upon the body of oil, water, or other iiuid employed, and hence relieving the proximate surfaces or faces of said relatively moving parts of wear and friction. .ln other words, I impose the load under which the bearing operates upon the body of oil, water, or other medium employed instead of upon the contacting surfaces of the relatively moving parts. Since the pressure of the medium delivered, as above described, is somewhat in excess of the thrust or load which the parts of the bearing are designed to receive, it will be noted that\u0026#39;the tendency of the body of oil, water, or other medium under pressure is to separate the relatively moving parts C and B2 and for the body of oil, water, or other medium to receive the load.  \n  It is obvious, as above indicated, that the oil, water, or other medium supplied as set forth may be delivered and the pressure thereof regulated, controlled, and maintained constant, when desired, by other specific forms of mechanism. I do not desire, therefore, to be limited or restricted in this respect.  \n  In order that the water, oil, or other medium may be efiiciently delivered between the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts B2 and C, the delivery-pipe D of the pump D is arranged to extend to a point between such surfaces. In practice it has been found desirable and preferable to provide a chamber or recess of considerable area in the surface of one or both of the relatively moving parts B2 and C. into which pipe D delivers, and to this end, as indicated at c\u0026#39;, a comparatively wide channel or groove is provided. If desired, and preferably, this channel or groove may be arranged in central relation with respect to the transverse area of the adjacent or proximate surfaces of the relatively7 movingl parts. I do not desire, however, to be limited or restricted in this respect, as variations therefrom may be made, if desired, without departure from the spirit or scope of myinvention. Asalooveindicated,this groove or channel may be formed in the surface of either or both of the parts B2 and C. I have shown said channel or groove formed centrally in the surface of the part C, but my invention is not to be limited or restricted to such construction and arrangement.  \n By the construction above set forth it willv be seen that the body of oil, water, or other medium supplied as described will be confined within the channel or groove ,0\u0026#39; by the adjacent faces or surfaces of the relatively moving parts B2 and C; but inasmuch as the pressure under which the oil, water, or other medium is supplied somewhat exceeds the thrust or load imposed upon the bearing, in operation the relatively moving parts of the bearing are slightly separated from each other, thus causing the load to be imposed upon the exposed surface of the body of fluid or liquid, and the pressure under which the oil or other medium is supplied is so regulated with reference to the load that a too great separation of the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts is avoided, thus avoiding an undue iow of the oil, water, or other medium out from the channel or groove c and between the surfaces of the relatively moving parts and over the edges of the latter to waste.  \n - Thus in practice it is possible to maintain the oil, Water, or other medium in channel or groove c under a pressure of, say, one hundred pounds per square inch. Now by providing a channel or groove which will permit of the exposure of, say, four hundred square inches of surface of the oil, water, or other medium it will be seen that the thrust-bearing will be able to carry a load of twenty tons without friction upon the surface of either of the relatively moving parts, this entire load being taken or carried by the oil, water, or other medium.  \n  By locating the channel or groove c\u0026#39; about midway the transverse width of the relatively moving surfaces or parts of the bearing it will be seen that the load is imposed at a point where the main work of the bearing is done, for after the relatively moving parts of the bearing are slightly separated the pressure medium will to some extent escape from the channel. or groove c\u0026#39; and be forced out between the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts on each side of the channel or groove in a thin layer or film, thus affording efcient lubrication where the pressure medium employed is a lubricating-oil. Where a lubricant is employed as the pressure me dium, it is desirable to provide means where.- by the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts of the bearing will continue to be lubricated, for some time at least, without injury should for any reason the pump fail to operate or the pressure upon the medium be otherwise reduced. This result may be accomplished in different ways. A simple and convenient arrangement is disclosed wherein grooves c2 are provided in the surface of one or the other, or both, of the relatively moving parts of the thrust-bearing and radiating from the central channel or groove c\u0026#39;, thereby aiding in efficiently spreading the lubricant throughout the area of the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts B2 C.  \n  If desired, means for returning or saving from waste any oil, water, or other medium which may be forced out over the edges of the relatively moving parts may be provided. Many specifically-different constructions for accomplishing this result may be devised without departing from the spirit or scope of my invention. I have shown a simple construction and arrangement for effecting this object, andwhich I have found in practice to be eflicient, wherein is employed a casing A, provided with a flange or extension arranged to inclose or surround the relatively moving parts of the bearing, thereby forming a gutter or channel a, into which any oil or other inid which may be forced out from between the surfaces of the parts B2 C of the thrust-bearing may drip or be received. A similar channel L3 may be formed at the other edge of therelatively moving parts B2 C, and suitable transverse passages a may serve to open communication between the gutters or channels L (La. The oil or other medium thus collected in the channel or gutter a may be returned to the IOO pipe communicating with said channel or gutter, as and for the purpose set forth.  \n  5.

This retardation may be effected in many different ways. In Fig. 3 is shown one arrangement wherein grooves, as J, are formed in the surface of one or the other of the relatively moving parts B24 and C. It will be seen that the oil, water, or other medium when forced against the sides or edges of these grooves will be momentarily retarded.  \n  In Fig. 4L are shown projections K, formed on one of the relatively moving parts B2 C, arranged to project into the grooves J, formed in the adjacent surface \u0026#39;of the other of said parts. By this construction the pressure medium is forced through a tortuous path before it finally escapes, thereby retarding and impeding such escapement.  \n  A thrust-bearing embodying the principles above set forth, while applicable for use generally wherever thrust-bearings are employed, is particularly designed for use as a thrustbearing for the presses of the type shown in Patents No. 581,600, granted April 27, 1897, and No. 630,369, granted August 8, 1899, to George A. Lowry, and Ihave shown my invention applied to a construction of press of this type, the casing A, above referred, forming part of the framework of the press, and B the compression sleeve or holder mounted in casing A for rotation relatively thereon, such rotation being\u0026#39; imparted to the sleeve or holder B through the gear B in the usual manner, as fully disclosed in the patents referred to. The parts B2 and C constitute the supporting-bearing for the sleeve B and receive the thrust imposed thereon during the operation of the compressing apparatus, and the parts B2 and C are in the form of rings encircling the sleeve, the channel or groove c being formed in the surface of ring C. The part B2 may be formed integrally with the gear-sleeve B, and similarly the ring C may be formed integrally with the casing A. In practice, however, I prefer to form the parts B2 and C separately from the gear-sleeve B and casing A, respectively, but suitably attached to these parts by means of dowel-pins c or otherwise, as may be convenient. By mal;- ing these rings separable I am enabled to replace the same when worn by sand, grit, or other foreign matter getting between the adjacent surfaces thereof. If desired, and in order to secure lightness, the ring C may be provided on its under surface with grooves or recesses c3. rIhe grooves or passages a\u0026#39; are formed in the particular form shown in the surface of the casing\u0026#39; A, upon which the ring\u0026#39; C rests, and thus the passages a permit free l sure between said bearing parts, and a returncommunication between the gutters or spaces at the inner and outer edges of the bearingsurfaces.  \n  From the foregoing description it will be seen that lv provide an exceedingly simple, inexpensive, and efiicient construction of thrustbearing wherein the load is taken or imposed u pon a pressure medium instead of upon contacting\u0026#39; relatively moving metallic surfaces and wherein the relatively moving surfaces are maintained in eiicient lubrication.  \n  In practice I prefer to employ bearing-surfaces of differing\u0026#39; metals or materials. For instance, the bearing-surface of ring B2 may be of iron and that of part C may be of brass. I do not, however, desire to be limited in this respect.  \n  It is obvious that many variations and changes in the details of construction and arrangement would readily suggest themselves to persons skilled in the art and still fall within the spirit and scope of my invention. I do not desire, therefore, to be limited or restricted to the exact details of construction and arrangement shown and described; but,  \n  Having now set forth the object and nature of my invention and a construction embodying the principles thereof, what I claim as new and useful and of my own invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-  \n  l.

HOLMES, a citizen of the United States, residing at Hoosick Falls, in the county of Rensselaer and State of New York, have invented new and useful Thrust-Bearing, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis invention relates to thrust-bearings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The object of the invention is to provide means whereby the load imposed upon the bearing is taken by a body of oil, water, or other fluid. under pressure.` \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A further object of the invention is to provide means for maintaining a body of oil, water, or other fluid under pressure between the adjacent or juxtaposited surfaces of the thrustbearing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A further object of the invention is to provide means for efficiently lubricating' the parts of the bearing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Other objects of the invention will appear more fully hereinafter. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The invention consists, substantially, in the construction, combination, location, and arrangement of parts, all as will be more fully hereinafter set forth, as shown in the accompanying drawings, and linally pointed Vout in the appended claims. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring' to the accompanying' drawings and to the various views and reference-signs appearing thereon, Figure l is a longitudinal central section through a thrust-bearing construction embodying the principles of my invention. Fig. 2 is a transverse section on the line 2 2 of Fig. l looking in the direction of the arrows. Figs. 3 and 4 are detail views in transverse section. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The same part is designated by the sam reference-sign wherever it occurs throughout the several views. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In carrying out my invention I propose to maintain a body of oil, water, or other suitable fluid or liquid under pressure between the adjacent or juxtaposited faces or surfaces of the relatively moving parts of the thrustu bearing, whereby the load imposed upon the bearing when in operation is taken by the body of oil, water, or other liuid, thereby relieving such adjacent faces or surfaces of the, relatively moving parts of undue wear and friction. By employing a body of oil for this purpose I also provide means whereby the relatively moving parts are maintained in eflicient lubrication. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the drawings reference-signs B2 and O designate, respectively, relatively moving' parts of a thrust-bearing, and in carrying out my inventionv I deliver between the adjacent or juxtaposited surfaces of these relatively moving' parts oil, water, or other suitable liquid or fluid under pressure in such manner that the load imposed upon the bearing may be taken by the body of oil, water, or other medium employed. The delivery of the oil, water, or other medium and the pressure thereof may be effected in any suitable or convenient manner. In the particular form shown, to which, however, the invention is not limited, the oil, water, or other medium is delivered between the adjacent or juxtaposited surfaces of the relatively moving parts E C of the bearing' through the delivery-pipe fD of a pump D', \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. and, if desired, said pump may` be in communication wlth a tank or other source of supply E. In this manner and by this arrangement it will be seen that the oil, water, or the like may be delivered between the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts B\"a O under any desired and constant pressure. In practice I propose to deliver the oil, water, or other medium between said relatively moving surfaces under a pressure somewhat exceeding' the amount of thrust or load which the bearing is intended to receive, thus and there by supporting' one of the relatively moving parts upon the body of oil, water, or other iiuid employed, and hence relieving the proximate surfaces or faces of said relatively moving parts of wear and friction. .ln other words, I impose the load under which the bearing operates upon the body of oil, water, or other medium employed instead of upon the contacting surfaces of the relatively moving parts. Since the pressure of the medium delivered, as above described, is somewhat in excess of the thrust or load which the parts of the bearing are designed to receive, it will be noted that'the tendency of the body of oil, water, or other medium under pressure is to separate the relatively moving parts C and B2 and for the body of oil, water, or other medium to receive the load. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is obvious, as above indicated, that the oil, water, or other medium supplied as set forth may be delivered and the pressure thereof regulated, controlled, and maintained constant, when desired, by other specific forms of mechanism. I do not desire, therefore, to be limited or restricted in this respect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In order that the water, oil, or other medium may be efiiciently delivered between the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts B2 and C, the delivery-pipe D of the pump D is arranged to extend to a point between such surfaces. In practice it has been found desirable and preferable to provide a chamber or recess of considerable area in the surface of one or both of the relatively moving parts B2 and C. into which pipe D delivers, and to this end, as indicated at c', a comparatively wide channel or groove is provided. If desired, and preferably, this channel or groove may be arranged in central relation with respect to the transverse area of the adjacent or proximate surfaces of the relatively7 movingl parts. I do not desire, however, to be limited or restricted in this respect, as variations therefrom may be made, if desired, without departure from the spirit or scope of myinvention. Asalooveindicated,this groove or channel may be formed in the surface of either or both of the parts B2 and C. I have shown said channel or groove formed centrally in the surface of the part C, but my invention is not to be limited or restricted to such construction and arrangement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the construction above set forth it willv be seen that the body of oil, water, or other medium supplied as described will be confined within the channel or groove ,0' by the adjacent faces or surfaces of the relatively moving parts B2 and C; but inasmuch as the pressure under which the oil, water, or other medium is supplied somewhat exceeds the thrust or load imposed upon the bearing, in operation the relatively moving parts of the bearing are slightly separated from each other, thus causing the load to be imposed upon the exposed surface of the body of fluid or liquid, and the pressure under which the oil or other medium is supplied is so regulated with reference to the load that a too great separation of the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts is avoided, thus avoiding an undue iow of the oil, water, or other medium out from the channel or groove c and between the surfaces of the relatively moving parts and over the edges of the latter to waste. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Thus in practice it is possible to maintain the oil, Water, or other medium in channel or groove c under a pressure of, say, one hundred pounds per square inch. Now by providing a channel or groove which will permit of the exposure of, say, four hundred square inches of surface of the oil, water, or other medium it will be seen that the thrust-bearing will be able to carry a load of twenty tons without friction upon the surface of either of the relatively moving parts, this entire load being taken or carried by the oil, water, or other medium. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e By locating the channel or groove c' about midway the transverse width of the relatively moving surfaces or parts of the bearing it will be seen that the load is imposed at a point where the main work of the bearing is done, for after the relatively moving parts of the bearing are slightly separated the pressure medium will to some extent escape from the channel. or groove c' and be forced out between the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts on each side of the channel or groove in a thin layer or film, thus affording efcient lubrication where the pressure medium employed is a lubricating-oil. Where a lubricant is employed as the pressure me dium, it is desirable to provide means where.- by the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts of the bearing will continue to be lubricated, for some time at least, without injury should for any reason the pump fail to operate or the pressure upon the medium be otherwise reduced. This result may be accomplished in different ways. A simple and convenient arrangement is disclosed wherein grooves c2 are provided in the surface of one or the other, or both, of the relatively moving parts of the thrust-bearing and radiating from the central channel or groove c', thereby aiding in efficiently spreading the lubricant throughout the area of the adjacent surfaces of the relatively moving parts B2 C. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e If desired, means for returning or saving from waste any oil, water, or other medium which may be forced out over the edges of the relatively moving parts may be provided. Many specifically-different constructions for accomplishing this result may be devised without departing from the spirit or scope of my invention. I have shown a simple construction and arrangement for effecting this object, andwhich I have found in practice to be eflicient, wherein is employed a casing A, provided with a flange or extension arranged to inclose or surround the relatively moving parts of the bearing, thereby forming a gutter or channel a, into which any oil or other inid which may be forced out from between the surfaces of the parts B2 C of the thrust-bearing may drip or be received.

I  \n  My invention relates to improvements in slubbing, intermediate, and roving frames; and the object of my invention is to dispense with the bands of two diameters and to improve the machine for which Letters Patent were granted to me in Great Britain on the 16th day of February, 1898, and numbered 3,844.  \n  In my improved machine I take the slivers from the drawing-frame, in which a slight twist has been put into them, and pass the slivers in the slubbing frame through the usual drawing-rollers, from which the two slivers to form a slubbing are each passed through a separate twisting head. These twisting-heads are driven by bands from a tin drum or its equivalent, and suitable means are employed to stop one twisting-head and band while the other is in motion and then to change motion from one to the other alternately at the desired periods of time. In this manner when the slivers meet as they issue from the twistingheads they are slightly twisted together and pass immediately through a pair of rollers, from which they pass into and through a twisting-head, to which a rotary motion is imparted first in one direction and then in the other, which thus adds a little more twist and makes a slubbing. This slubbing iswound into a bobbin with taper ends in the following manner: A paper tube for the slubbing is laid, as usual, upon a driving-drum, and the traverse-guides are mounted upon a rail, to which a reciprocating motion is imparted in any convenient manner, and to-shorten the traverse of the rail I employ a long screw, attached to the top of which is a ratchet-Wheel, into-the teeth of which two pawls gear, and a projection upon the traverserail moves at each reciprocating movement first one pawl and then the other, and so turns the screw slightly, which automatically shortens the traverse, and so builds a bobbin with taper ends.  \n In the accompanying three sheets of drawings, Figure 1 is a front elevation of part of mounted the stands 3 for the drawing-rollers 4:. On the driving-shaft 5 are mounted a pair of fast and loose pulleys 6 and a grooved pulley 7, which drives by a band a grooved pulley 8, secured upon a shaft which carries a worm 9, in gear with a worm-Wheel 10,-secured upon a shaft 11, on which is also se cured a heart-cam 12, which drives the building motion.  \n  The slubbings or the like are held in a creel, and the two ends from adjoining bobbins are passed through the pairs of drawing-rollers 4, and\u0026#39;each slubbing is then passed separately through a twisting-head 13, which receives an intermittent rotary motion, as in my aforesaid British patent, but by the following improved means: A pinion 14 upon the driving shaft 5 gears into and drives a wheel 15, mounted upon a stud, and on the boss of this wheel is secured a chain-wheel 16, which by means of a chain 18 and wheel 19 gives motion to a shaft 20. A grooved pulley on this shaft drives by a band 21 a shaft 22, upon which is secured two grooved driving-pulleys 23, over each of which passes a cord 24. These cords 24 also pass over a pair of guide-pulleys 25, mounted upon a single stud secured upon a weighted arm 26, and then each cord passes over a wharve on one ofthe twisting-heads 13. Each cord 24: also passes between a pivoted lever 27 and a grooved bar 28, and a reciproeating notched bar 29 (actuated by a cam 30, mounted upon the shaft 20 and intermediate rods and levers) acts alternately upon the ends of the levers 27 to close first one and then the other onto the grooved bar 28, as shown in Fig. 8, in which the front lever is gripping one of the driving-cords 24 against the bar 28, thereby stopping the rotation of one twistinghead 13. while the other cord 24, passing freely under the lever 27, drives the other twistinghead 13 until the next movement of the notch ed bar 29 takes place, when the position of the levers 27 will be reversed and the other twist ing-head 13 only will be driven.  \n  The twisting-heads 13 may be driven inthe same or in reverse directions, but preferably in opposite directions, and they put a little twist into each slubbing. The slubbings then pass through a pair of rollers 31, and from there they enter together a single twistinghead 32, which is driven first in one direction and then in the other by the following means: To an eccentric stud 33, secured on a disk 34 (see Fig. 3) upon the shaft 20, is pivoted a rack 35, which gears into apinion 36, mounted upon a shaft 37, which is thus driven alternately backward and forward. A grooved pulley 33 upon this shaft transmits motion by a cord 39, which passes over guide-pulleys 40, mounted upon a weighted arm 41, to the twistinghead 32, which is thus driven first in one direction and then inthe other. This twistinghead is preferably made as shown in Fig. 10. The roving enters the twisting-head at the right-hand end, passes through it for some distance and then out at a hole in the side of the twisting-head, then half-way round the outside of the twisting -head, entering the twisting-head again at 61 to the center, from which it is taken up by a winding on tube 17. The tubes 17, upon which the rovings are to be wound, are supported upon tin drums 42, which are driven in any convenient manner, and the rovings pass from each twistinghead 32 as nearly as possible into the nip of the tube 17 and drum 42. The stands 43, which carry the drums and twisting-heads, are secured upon a reciprocating rail 44, supported upon rollers 45,and one end of the rail 44 is secured to a slotted plate 46, forming part of the building motion, which is actuated by the heart-cam 12, Fig. 1. The cam 12 lies in contact with a bowl 47 on a pivoted arm 48, and to the lower end of this arm is connected a rod 49, which is pressed back against the rotating cam by a weighted elbow-lever 50. The other end of the rod 49 is connected to an arm 51, secured to a shaft 52, on which is secured a bracket 53, that carries a screw 54, and a change ratchetwheel 55 is mounted upon this screw. Two spring-pawls 56 57 rest normally in the teeth of this wheel and prevent a weight and cord 58 from turning the screw. Upon the screw 54 is fitted a nut 59, and a projecting stud 60 upon this nut passes through a long slot in a plate (not shown) secured to the bracket 53 and also through a slot in the plate 46. An adjustable stop-piece 61 acts upon the pawl 56 when the rail 44 is moved into its farthest position to the left hand and a second adjustable stop-piece 62 acts upon the other pawl, 57, when the rail 44 reaches its extreme position at the right hand, the ratchet-wheel 55 being thus temporarily released and the screw 54 being turned a distance corresponding to half a tooth of the ratchet-wheel at each backward or forward movement of the rail 44, the traverse of which is thus gradually and automatically diminished during the building of the taper ends of the bobbins. After a set of bobbins has been wound the screw 54 is turned back by hand to wind up the weight and cord 58 before beginning a fresh set.  \n  The device herein shown and described for alternately stopping and releasing the cords 24 is that which I prefer to use; but I wish it to be understood that I might employ any other suitable device for the same purpose. Again, instead of the tension device (consisting of guide-pulleys or weighted arms) for the driving-cords I might employ any other suitable means for tightening the cords and maintaining them at the-proper tension, and, further, I might employ any other suitable reversing motion for driving the cord 39 and tube 32 in two directions.  \n  VVhatI claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States, 1s-  \n  1.

Serial No. 185,154.  \n  Be it known that I, ORLANDO Ewnns, a citizen of the United States, residing at Readstown, in the county of Vernon and State of lvisconsin, have invented a new and useful FireEscape, of which the following is a specilication.  \n  This invention relates to means whereby persons may escape from burning buildings, and has for its object to produce a device of this character simple in construction, easily and quickly attached, and by means of which persons may safely lower themselves from any height and control the speed of the descent; and the invention consists in certain novel features of construction, as hereinafter shown and described, and specilied in the claims.  \n  In the drawings illustrative of the invention, in which corresponding parts are denoted by like designating characters, Figure 1 is a sectional front elevation. Fig. 2 is a sectional side elevation.  \n  The improved device comprises an inclosing casing 10, having guide-apertures 11 12 in its ends and a roller 13 mounted for rotation therein upon a stud 14, as shown. A suspension-cable 15 is provided long enough to reach to the ground from the point of descent and may vary in length to correspond to the building upon which it is used. The cable will preferably be of steel wire as small as consistent with the strains to which it will be subjected, but may be of rope or any suitable material, and l do not, therefore, desire to be limited to any specified quality or form of material for this portion of the apparatus. The cable will be provided with means, such as a hook 16, to connect its upper end to some permanent object, such as a window-sill. rlhe cable will pass through the apertures 11 12 and be wound once or more around the roller 13 within the casing, as shown, the roller being preferably grooved to support the cable.  \n  Fulcrumed at 17 within the casing is a lever 1S, with its shorter end recessed and bearing upon the portion of the cable wound around the .roller and with the cable preferably eX- tending loosely through the lever between its pivot and its gripping end, as shown at 19. Pivoted at 2O within the casing 10 is another form of a U-shaped rod 23 with the ends connected, respectively, to the free ends of the levers 18 and 21 and providing means for supporting\u0026#39; an approved form of suspensionharness, as at 24.  \n  lonnected to the gripping end of the lever 18 is a rod 25, terminating in a handle 26 outside of the casing 1() and within reach of the person supported by the harness 24. By this simple arrangement when a person desires to descend from a burning building the hook 16 is connected over a window-sill or other permanent support, the harness 2A secured about the body, and the person climbs from the window, permitting the weight to bear upon the harness, which causes the lever 18 to firmly grip the cable upon the roller 13 and effectually prevent any downward movement of the casing and its attachments.  \n  The person in the harness by drawingdownward upon the handle 26 releases the lever 18 and permits the roller, with the casing and its attachments, to slide down the cable, and, the speed of the descent, it will be obvious, can be perfectly and easily controlled by regulating the degree of force exerted on the rod 25. By this simple means persons can permit themselves to descend at any desired speed or stop the descent at any required point.  \n  The parts will preferably be of metal of suflicient quality and strength to resist the strains to which they will be subjected and may be modified in minor particulars without departing from the principle of the invention or sacrificing any of its advantages.  \n  A relatively small wire, as at 27, will be attached by one end to the casing 1() and by the other end to some portion of the building and as long as the distance which the casing\u0026#39; will travel to provide means whereby the latter, together with its sling and other attachment, may be drawn upward again for further use, if required.  \n  Having thus described the invention, what is claimed isH 1. A fire-escape comprising a roller, a suspension-cable engaging said roller, alever fulcrumed adjacent to said roller and bearing against the cable thereon, and with the cable passing loosely therethrough between its pivot and gripping end, a supporting means suspended from the free end of said lever, and a releasing device connected to the gripping end of said lever and under the control of the person in said supporting means.  \n  2. A tire-escape comprising a casing having vertically alined guide apertures, a roller mounted for rotation in said casing, a suspen sion-cable extending through said apertures and engaging said roller, a lever fulcrumed in said casing and bearing upon the cable upon said roller, the cable passing through a guideopening in the lever, a supporting means suspended from the free end ot\u0026#39; said lever, and a releasing device connected to the gripping end of said lever and. projected through one of the guide-apertures in the casing to be under the control of the person in said supporting\u0026#39; means.  \n A lireescape comprising a casing having vertically alined guide apertures, a roller vmounted for rotation in said casing, a suspension-cable extending through said apertures and engaging said roller, a lever fulcrumed in said casing and bearing upon the cable upon said roller, the cable passing through an opening in the lever7 a supporting means of substantially U shape hung below the casing with one end connected to the free end of the le*` ver and the other end to the casing, and a releasing-rod connected to the gripping end of said lever and projected through the lower guide-aperture of the casing to be under the control of the person in the suspending means.  \n  In testimony that I claim the foregoing as my own I have hereto atxed my signature in the presence of two witnesses.  \n ORLANDO EVERS.  \n lVitnesses:  \n EDGAR Ewnus, AoHILLEs EWERS.","language":"en","truncated":false}],"description_localized_html":[{"text":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e PATENTED DB0. 27, 1904. o.

Serial No. 201,695.  \n T0 at whom it may concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, TIIoMAs I. DUFFY, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Chicago, in the county of Cook and State of Illi-. nois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Hinges; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification.  \n  This invention relates to improvements in hinges; and among the objects of the invention is to produce a hinge which is simple in construction, neat and attractive in appearance, and which is strong and durable, not only in itself, but with respect to its connection to the swinging part to which the hinge is attached; 1  \n The invention consists in the matters hereinafter set forth, and more particularly pointed out in the appended claims.  \n  My improved hinge is herein shown as adapted and applied to connect the swinging seat and lid of a water-closet apparatus to the bowl thereof; but it will be understood that a hinge having the peculiar and novel attributes which characterize my improvements may be applied wherever it is desired to swingingly connect one part with anotheri- Inasmuch, however, as the construction of said hinge lends itself with peculiar adaptability to the connection between the water-closet seat and lidand the bowl, claims are herein made for this adaptation.  \n  In the drawings, Figure l is a fragmentary vertical section taken through a water-closet bowl, seat, and lid, showing my improved hinge applied thereto. Fig. 2 is a top plan View of the parts shown in Fig. 1. Figs. 3 and 4 are a plan view and a side elevation, respectively, of the hinge for the lid. Figs. 5 and 6 are similar views of the hinge for the seat. Figs. 7 and 8 are two side elevations of an improved form of post to which the hinges are pivotedf Fig. 9 is a perspective view of a washer which constitutes part of the means for fastening the hinge in place. Fig. 10 is a view similar\u0026#39;to Fig. 1, showing a slightlymodified form of post. Fig. 11 illustrates the relative positions of the companion upper and lower lid and seat hinges when connected with the post shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 12 is a fragmentary bottom plan view of the seat shown in Fig. 1 and one of the hinges applied thereto. Fig. 13 is a view similar to Fig. 1, showing a stillfurther modification. Fig. .14 is a horizontal section taken on line 14 14 of Fig. 13 looking upwardly.  \n . As shown in the drawings, A designates a closet-bowl of conventional form, B a seat, and C the lid thereof. E F, Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10,11, and 12, designate the hinge members for the lid and seat, respectively, which are hinged to suitably-shaped posts Gr, Figs. 1, 2, 7 and 8, the lower ends of which are extended to form bolts G, which extend through openings in the usual flange A at the rear of the bowl, one post being located at each side of the center of the flange, as shown in Fig. 2. The posts are fastened in place by nuts G having screw-threaded engagement with the lower screw-threaded ends of the posts,  \n and yieldingwashers g are interposed between said nuts and the lower faces of said flange. A stamped metal washer Gr surrounds the post above the flange A and is interposed between the flange and an annular shoulder on the post. The form of post thus described may be conveniently turned from a rectangular cross-section bar. The posts are provided at their upper ends with heads, each having two sockets g 9 located one vertically over the other.  \n  The hinge members E F are of peculiar construction, each being made of a single piece of wrought-metal rod or wire of the necessary diameter to give the required streng th thereto and-bent upon itselfto constitute atone end a closed eye 6 f, two shanks e f, and lugs 6 f the lugs of each hinge member being directed inwardly toward each other, Figs. 3 to 6, inclusive. The sockets g of the posts Gr are adapted to receive the lugse of the upper hinge members E, the lugs of eachhingemember entering its associated socket from the op-\u0026#39; posite sides\u0026#39;thereof, as clearly indicated in Fig. 2. G receive in like manner lugs f of the lower hinge members attached to the seat B. In  \n The lower sockets g of said posts asmuch as the lid C is located at a greater distance from said seat-lugs than the seat 15, the upper hinge members E are made somewhat longer than the lower hinge members F, as is clearly shown in Fig. 1, and the shanks of said hinge members are curved downwardly and upwardly from the planes of the lower faces of the lid and seat, respectively, to bring the lugs 6 in line with the sockets g Next referring to the manner of attaching the hinge members to the lid and seat, such attaching means are constructed as follows: The seat and lid are provided on their lower faces with counter-bores or sockets, which are made of such size as to receive the eyes a f of the hinge members E F, and extending rearwardly from each of said counterbores or sockets are rearwardly-directed grooves c b, as more clearly indicated in Figs. 1 and 12, which receive the shanks of the hinge members. Said hinge members are fastened to the seat and lid by means of bolts H 1, ex-  \n tending downwardly through the seat and lid, respectively, and centrally through the eyes cf of said hinges and extend at their lower ends through concave washers H I, which are made of such size as to fit within the counterbores or sockets c 5. Said washers overlap at their margins the ring parts of the eyes, and the concave parts of said washers enter the said eyes, as shown in Figs. 1 and 12. The bolts H 1 are provided with nuts 2\u0026#39;, which fit in the concave parts of the washers H l and engage the screw-threaded ends of said bolts. Said bolts are turned downwardly into said nuts, being for this purpose provided with slots in their heads. Preferably the heads are countersunk in the upper faces of the lid and seat. The said eyes ef of the hinge members are thus clamped firmly in the counterbores or sockets of the lid and seat, and the shanks of the hinge members are by the same means secured in the grooves b c of the seat and lid. It will be furthermore observed that when the hinge members are fixed in place in the manner described the shanks thereof are prevented from separating, and therefore the hinge-lugs e f are prevented from becoming detached from the sockets in the posts G. i  \n  In the construction shown in Figs. 10 and 11 the sockets of the posts J are located side by side or one in front of the other and in the same plane, and the rear ends of the hinge-shanks are correspondingly curved to adapt themselves to such form of sockets. The shanks of the hinge members shown in Fig. 10 are offset downwardly at their connections with the eyes and do not enter grooves in the under faces of the seat and lid, as in the previously-described construction. The washers H I are therefore correspondingly varied or modified in form.  \n  In the construction shown in Figs. 13 and 14 the upper and lower hinge members K L differ from the prior construction in that said hinge members each comprises an eye k 7 and a single shank Z/ Z. In this construction each of the posts M with which said hinge members are connected is provided with a single socket, and the lugs Z? Z of the companion upper and lower hinge members K L for the seat and lid, respectively, at each side enter said sockets from opposite sides of the post. The lugs of the pair of single-shank hinge members of the lid are indicated as directed inwardly toward each other and enter the sockets of the posts M from the outer sides, while the similar lugs of the hinge members L are directed in opposite directions and enter the sockets of the posts from the inner sides thereof, so that when the hinge members are in place they are prevented from becoming detached from the lugs by reason of their rigid connection with the lid and seat, respectively. The hinge members shown in Figs. 13 and 14 are fastened in place by bolts each consisting of two parts N N, the upper part being provided with a head and with an interiorlyscrew-thread ed socket and the lower part with a head and exterior screw-threzuls toengage the interior screw-thrczulcd socket of the other part. Both of said heads are slotted to receive an implement by which the bolt is turned in place.  \n  As before stated, my improved hinge is capable of adaptation to other uses and when otherwise employed will be varied in its form to conform to such varied uses. The hinge being composed principally of wrought or drawn metal may be made of ample strength and at the same time light and of attractive proportions.  \n I claim as my invention 1.

DUFFY, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Chicago, in the county of Cook and State of Illi-. nois, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Hinges; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates to improvements in hinges; and among the objects of the invention is to produce a hinge which is simple in construction, neat and attractive in appearance, and which is strong and durable, not only in itself, but with respect to its connection to the swinging part to which the hinge is attached; 1 \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe invention consists in the matters hereinafter set forth, and more particularly pointed out in the appended claims. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My improved hinge is herein shown as adapted and applied to connect the swinging seat and lid of a water-closet apparatus to the bowl thereof; but it will be understood that a hinge having the peculiar and novel attributes which characterize my improvements may be applied wherever it is desired to swingingly connect one part with anotheri- Inasmuch, however, as the construction of said hinge lends itself with peculiar adaptability to the connection between the water-closet seat and lidand the bowl, claims are herein made for this adaptation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the drawings, Figure l is a fragmentary vertical section taken through a water-closet bowl, seat, and lid, showing my improved hinge applied thereto. Fig. 2 is a top plan View of the parts shown in Fig. 1. Figs. 3 and 4 are a plan view and a side elevation, respectively, of the hinge for the lid. Figs. 5 and 6 are similar views of the hinge for the seat. Figs. 7 and 8 are two side elevations of an improved form of post to which the hinges are pivotedf Fig. 9 is a perspective view of a washer which constitutes part of the means for fastening the hinge in place. Fig. 10 is a view similar'to Fig. 1, showing a slightlymodified form of post. Fig. 11 illustrates the relative positions of the companion upper and lower lid and seat hinges when connected with the post shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 12 is a fragmentary bottom plan view of the seat shown in Fig. 1 and one of the hinges applied thereto. Fig. 13 is a view similar to Fig. 1, showing a stillfurther modification. Fig. .14 is a horizontal section taken on line 14 14 of Fig. 13 looking upwardly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. As shown in the drawings, A designates a closet-bowl of conventional form, B a seat, and C the lid thereof. E F, Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10,11, and 12, designate the hinge members for the lid and seat, respectively, which are hinged to suitably-shaped posts Gr, Figs. 1, 2, 7 and 8, the lower ends of which are extended to form bolts G, which extend through openings in the usual flange A at the rear of the bowl, one post being located at each side of the center of the flange, as shown in Fig. 2. The posts are fastened in place by nuts G having screw-threaded engagement with the lower screw-threaded ends of the posts, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand yieldingwashers g are interposed between said nuts and the lower faces of said flange. A stamped metal washer Gr surrounds the post above the flange A and is interposed between the flange and an annular shoulder on the post. The form of post thus described may be conveniently turned from a rectangular cross-section bar. The posts are provided at their upper ends with heads, each having two sockets g 9 located one vertically over the other. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The hinge members E F are of peculiar construction, each being made of a single piece of wrought-metal rod or wire of the necessary diameter to give the required streng th thereto and-bent upon itselfto constitute atone end a closed eye 6 f, two shanks e f, and lugs 6 f the lugs of each hinge member being directed inwardly toward each other, Figs. 3 to 6, inclusive. The sockets g of the posts Gr are adapted to receive the lugse of the upper hinge members E, the lugs of eachhingemember entering its associated socket from the op-' posite sides'thereof, as clearly indicated in Fig. 2. G receive in like manner lugs f of the lower hinge members attached to the seat B. In \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lower sockets g of said posts asmuch as the lid C is located at a greater distance from said seat-lugs than the seat 15, the upper hinge members E are made somewhat longer than the lower hinge members F, as is clearly shown in Fig. 1, and the shanks of said hinge members are curved downwardly and upwardly from the planes of the lower faces of the lid and seat, respectively, to bring the lugs 6 in line with the sockets g Next referring to the manner of attaching the hinge members to the lid and seat, such attaching means are constructed as follows: The seat and lid are provided on their lower faces with counter-bores or sockets, which are made of such size as to receive the eyes a f of the hinge members E F, and extending rearwardly from each of said counterbores or sockets are rearwardly-directed grooves c b, as more clearly indicated in Figs. 1 and 12, which receive the shanks of the hinge members. Said hinge members are fastened to the seat and lid by means of bolts H 1, ex- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etending downwardly through the seat and lid, respectively, and centrally through the eyes cf of said hinges and extend at their lower ends through concave washers H I, which are made of such size as to fit within the counterbores or sockets c 5. Said washers overlap at their margins the ring parts of the eyes, and the concave parts of said washers enter the said eyes, as shown in Figs. 1 and 12. The bolts H 1 are provided with nuts 2', which fit in the concave parts of the washers H l and engage the screw-threaded ends of said bolts. Said bolts are turned downwardly into said nuts, being for this purpose provided with slots in their heads. Preferably the heads are countersunk in the upper faces of the lid and seat. The said eyes ef of the hinge members are thus clamped firmly in the counterbores or sockets of the lid and seat, and the shanks of the hinge members are by the same means secured in the grooves b c of the seat and lid. It will be furthermore observed that when the hinge members are fixed in place in the manner described the shanks thereof are prevented from separating, and therefore the hinge-lugs e f are prevented from becoming detached from the sockets in the posts G. i \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the construction shown in Figs. 10 and 11 the sockets of the posts J are located side by side or one in front of the other and in the same plane, and the rear ends of the hinge-shanks are correspondingly curved to adapt themselves to such form of sockets. The shanks of the hinge members shown in Fig. 10 are offset downwardly at their connections with the eyes and do not enter grooves in the under faces of the seat and lid, as in the previously-described construction. The washers H I are therefore correspondingly varied or modified in form. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the construction shown in Figs. 13 and 14 the upper and lower hinge members K L differ from the prior construction in that said hinge members each comprises an eye k 7 and a single shank Z/ Z. In this construction each of the posts M with which said hinge members are connected is provided with a single socket, and the lugs Z? Z of the companion upper and lower hinge members K L for the seat and lid, respectively, at each side enter said sockets from opposite sides of the post. The lugs of the pair of single-shank hinge members of the lid are indicated as directed inwardly toward each other and enter the sockets of the posts M from the outer sides, while the similar lugs of the hinge members L are directed in opposite directions and enter the sockets of the posts from the inner sides thereof, so that when the hinge members are in place they are prevented from becoming detached from the lugs by reason of their rigid connection with the lid and seat, respectively. The hinge members shown in Figs. 13 and 14 are fastened in place by bolts each consisting of two parts N N, the upper part being provided with a head and with an interiorlyscrew-thread ed socket and the lower part with a head and exterior screw-threzuls toengage the interior screw-thrczulcd socket of the other part. Both of said heads are slotted to receive an implement by which the bolt is turned in place. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e As before stated, my improved hinge is capable of adaptation to other uses and when otherwise employed will be varied in its form to conform to such varied uses. The hinge being composed principally of wrought or drawn metal may be made of ample strength and at the same time light and of attractive proportions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI claim as my invention 1.

Application filed December 14,1904. .Serial No. 236,814.  \n Toui/ 11-h om it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, Axum: MIcHELIN, engineer, a citizen of the Republic of France, and a resident of 105 Boulevard vlreire, Paris, France, have invented new and useful 1mprovemcnts in Lever Apparatus for Mounting Pneumatic Tires upon \\Vheel-Rims, of which the following is a specification.  \n  When mounting a pneumatic tire upon the wheel-rim of a motor-car or other vehicle, the bringing into position of the second beaded edge of the cover necessitates a very careful operation, and in the ease of large pneumatic tires that have not yet been in use it requires considerable force. In order to cause the head of the cover edge to pass into the corresponding groove of the rim by the means at present employed by chauffeurs, it is neccssary to introduce a flat lever under the beaded edge which projects over the rim and to cause it to bear against the edge of the rim. it will be readily seen that the pneumatic tube is very close to this edge, which it even touches in many cases, and in particular if after considerable use the pneumatic tube has attained a diameter larger than that which it had originally. It will be evidentthat when an upward motion is imparted to the lever the pneumatic tube maybecome interposed between the bottom surface of the rim and the end of the lever, and thus risks becoming out by the pressure exerted by the lever. In order to avoid such a contingency,one is obliged to oper ate with very great care and to pusn back the pneumatic tube, so as to prevent it from passingunder the point of the lever. Notwithstanding all these precautions it frequently happens, even to the most experienced operators, to damage the pneumatic tube by means of the lever. ()n the other hand, the placing in position of the second beaded edge by means of the ordinary levers frequently requires the exerciseot\u0026#39;con. \u0026#39;derableforce,asalreadystated. Such, for example, is the case with large pneum atic tires having a diameter of from onehun; dred and five to one hundred and twenty millimeters, or even those of eighty-five or ninety millimeters, which have never before been mounted. Thisdiflicultyofmountingispartly due to the circumstance that the beaded edge slips on the lever, so that the point-is directed toward the operator instead of being directed toward the wheel-rim. In this position it is evidently impossible to cause the head to enter the groove of the rim. It is necessary to bring it back into the normal position by up and down movements of the lever, which are liable to damage the beaded edge.  \n  The present invention relates to a special construction of lever device which avoids the two above-named inconveniences and which possesses the advantage over levers of ordinary construction of requiring a much less powerful effort for obtaining the desired result and of not damaging the beaded edge of the covering. which is only subjected to a minimum degree of tension.  \n  I will describe my said invention with re.t erence to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 to 5 show the improved lever del vice in side view in the different positions into which it has to be successively brought for bringing into position in thewheel-rim the second beaded edge ot\u0026#39;a pneumatic-tire covering. These figures show, either completely or partially, in transverse section the wheel-rim, the pneumatic tube, and the cover, the two lastnamed\u0026#39; parts being shown in each of the ligures in the position which corresponds to that v of the lever. Fig. 6 shows a transverse section of a lever in which the pivoted tumbler is made forked, so as totit on both sides thereof. Fig. 7 shows a crosssection of a modification in which the lever is made with a looped part in which the tumbler is situated.  \n  The improved lever device consists,tirst,ot\u0026#39; a lever 0, the end 7) of which is curved and terminates in a book 0, with rounded edges; secondly, of a movable tumbler-lever I], having 99 somewhat the shape of a gun-trigger and which can pivot upon a pin fixed in the-lever at the beginning of the curved part thereof. This tumbler-lever can be made forked,  \n so as to tit over both sides of the lever, as  \n shown at Figs. 1 to 6, or it may be fitted into a looped part of the lever, as shown at Fig. 7. It is acted upon by a springfof any suitable form that will tend to bring it against a stop 9, iixed on the lever a.  \n IOO  \n  In Fig. 1 the cover it of the pneumatic tire has its one beaded edge, 27, placed in position, the second beaded edge, 3\u0026#39;, being tree. A is the pneumatic tube. Zis the steel wheel-rim fixed toawooden inner rim m. For bringing-the second beaded edge, j, into position on the wheel-rim the lever a is placed so that its hook bears upon the top of that edge of the wheel- \u0026#39;m with which the beaded edge is engaged. The lever is then moved upward, as indicated by the arrow, until the tumblerlever (Z comes in contact with the point of the free edge j, as at Fig. 1. In continuing the upward motion the beaded edge is made to bear completely upon the slightly-curved upper face of the tumbler-lever d, as shown at F1 g. 2, where the tail (if of the tumbler-lever is at the same time brought in cont-act with the under side of the wheel rim Z. The upward movement of the lever (6 being conti nued the tumbler-lever d, on the one han\u0026#39;d,has  \n its axis 0 moved upward, while. on the other hand, the tail d is held back by the wheel-rim, so that the tumbler-lever thus has a turning motion imparted to it, bringing it into the position\u0026#39;shown at Fig. 3, and consequently bringing the beaded edge j over the edge of the wheel-rim. When in this position, the beaded edge,in consequence of the compress condition of the cover,-will of itself slide down from the tumbler-lever (1 onto the bottom sur face of the wheel-rim, as shown at Fig. 4, from which position it will then automatically slide to the right hand, and thus assume its normal position in the groove of the wheelthe as shown at Fig. 5, after the lever ahas been lowered. The lever a is then removed.  \n  The-above-described operation is repeated at difi\u0026#39;erent parts of the tire, so as eventually to bring the entire beaded edge jot the cover into position.  \n When a short length of the beaded edge j of the cover-which has to be 1.

MYERS, of Baltimore, inthe-county of Baltimore, and State of Maryland, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Tuyeres; and\u0026#39;Ido hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which\u0026#39;- Figure 1 isa perspective view ofI my tuyere detached :from the forge.  \n Figure 2 is a vertical longitudinal section of the same in position.  \n My invention relates to that class of tuyeres which have an air-chamber between the nozzle ofthe bellows :1nd the orifice through which the air passes into the re, and it consists in providing thc bed, upon which the centre ot\u0026#39; the tire rests, with an open \u0026#39;escape-pipe, through which dust and tine ashes may escape from the bottom ofthe .lire while the bellows is in \u0026#34;operation, and through which a direct upward draught may pass to the fire when the bellows has \u0026#39;ceasedto operate. l o v l That others may understand the nature and construction of my invention, I will fullydescribe it.  \n A is the cast-iron shell, forming the air-chamberof my tuyere. This air-chamber may be of any desired size, though I linow ofno particular advantage to be derived from increasing its dimensions beyond what 1s necessary.  \n The air-chamber B has a neck or orifice at one side, for the admission of\u0026#39; the nozzle of the bellows, and at.  \n the top of the shell A is the flange E, by which the said shell is sustained in its position in thel bottom of the forge.  \n  Across the top ofthe plate or fiange are the two ridges, F, with a small ila-t space between them, and the two slots C C, penetrating from their inner slopes to the air-chamber B. These slots are the outlets for the air from the bellows. They are enlarged from their outer ends inward, and are inclined towards each other, as shown, so that currents of air, passing outward through them, would meet at a distance of four or five inchesiI These orifices C C. may bc. larger or smaller, according to\u0026#39; the quantity orsize of the re to be made, and, in practice, the part containing the ridges, F Il, I prefer to make separate from the plate E, and inserted therein, as shown in iig. 2, so that they can be made in sets. with orices of different sizes, and may be interchanged whenever it is desired. l  \n  It has been found that with a tuyere constructed as above, and with no addi-tional feature, the accumulation of dust and vashes at the point in the immediate vicinity of theblastholes would, in a little time, become a seriousinconvcnience.  \n  By experiment I have discovered that, by-insertng an open pipe similar to that shown at D, I can almost, ii\u0026#39; not perfectly, obviatc and correct all of these diii\u0026#39;iculties. This pipe is flattened at its upper end, so as t0 present the form of a narrow slot, extending between the ridges F F, and parallel withthem, and nearly or quite as long as therslots O O.\u0026#39; From thence itdescends through the air-chambervl, and opens beneath thevforgc in some open space left for that\u0026#39;purpose.\\  \n  When I construct the part of the. as above described, I also make the pi made permanent and tight.  \n The operation ot this pipe will be readily\u0026#39;undcrstood.  \n  While the bellows is in operation, the currents of air, passing outward tbr against the pieces of fuel lying above them, and there willbe a slight `1eaction, of air downward through the pipe D,`and this How will be suilieient to remove alwaysaccumulate at that point. When fresh fuel Vis mixed with that which escape of gas through thesam\u0026#39;e duct, and the likely to injure a piece f iron placedrin the fire to heat, ofthe fire, and gas generated above it would pass olf wit plate which contains the ridges and orifices separate from the remainder, pe\u0026#39;D in two parts, so that the joint at theupper end of said pipe may be ongh the orifices C C, impinge suliicient to cause a slight flow dust andline ashes, which\u0026#39;wrill is burning, there will also be an gas which so escapes is precisely the portion\u0026#39;which would be most because the iron to be heated. is\u0026#39; placed neur the bottom hout doing injury. When the bellows ceases to operate,-  \n  then there is an upward current immediately established through the pipe D, because air can gain access to the \u0026#34;fire more readily through said pipe than fromabove, through the eaked fuel.  \n  By this arrangement I secure a better heat, amore compact re, a cleaner-fire, and less inconvenience from dust and gas than can be attained by the use of any other tuyere with which I am acqnainted.  \n It is evident that the advantages of my open escape-ppe D may be obtained without adopting the wlioleof `the details of\u0026#39;construction which I have shown and described, andhen\u0026#39;ce I shouldconsider any escapewa\u0026#39;y having one end in communication with the fire, substantially in the manner described, and capable of conveying away the dust and lashes, while the bellows continues to operate, as above set forth, to embrace the principles et\u0026#34; my invention.  \n Having described my invention, what I claim as new, is-\u0026#39; l l An escape-pipe D, or its equivalent, independent of the ductwhicb conveys thevbla\u0026#39;st tothe fire, descending from the centre of the tuyere, to convey away ashes, dust, dic., from the bottom of the re, and to admit a direct draught when Athe bellows is not inl operation, substantially as set forth.  \n A tuyerc. constructed with the aircha`mbcr B, outlets C C, and the escape-pipe D, substantially as described.  \n i WM.

MYERS, of Baltimore, inthe-county of Baltimore, and State of Maryland, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Tuyeres; and'Ido hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which'- Figure 1 isa perspective view ofI my tuyere detached :from the forge. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigure 2 is a vertical longitudinal section of the same in position. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy invention relates to that class of tuyeres which have an air-chamber between the nozzle ofthe bellows :1nd the orifice through which the air passes into the re, and it consists in providing thc bed, upon which the centre ot' the tire rests, with an open 'escape-pipe, through which dust and tine ashes may escape from the bottom ofthe .lire while the bellows is in \"operation, and through which a direct upward draught may pass to the fire when the bellows has 'ceasedto operate. l o v l That others may understand the nature and construction of my invention, I will fullydescribe it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA is the cast-iron shell, forming the air-chamberof my tuyere. This air-chamber may be of any desired size, though I linow ofno particular advantage to be derived from increasing its dimensions beyond what 1s necessary. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air-chamber B has a neck or orifice at one side, for the admission of' the nozzle of the bellows, and at. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe top of the shell A is the flange E, by which the said shell is sustained in its position in thel bottom of the forge. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Across the top ofthe plate or fiange are the two ridges, F, with a small ila-t space between them, and the two slots C C, penetrating from their inner slopes to the air-chamber B. These slots are the outlets for the air from the bellows. They are enlarged from their outer ends inward, and are inclined towards each other, as shown, so that currents of air, passing outward through them, would meet at a distance of four or five inchesiI These orifices C C. may bc. larger or smaller, according to' the quantity orsize of the re to be made, and, in practice, the part containing the ridges, F Il, I prefer to make separate from the plate E, and inserted therein, as shown in iig. 2, so that they can be made in sets. with orices of different sizes, and may be interchanged whenever it is desired. l \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It has been found that with a tuyere constructed as above, and with no addi-tional feature, the accumulation of dust and vashes at the point in the immediate vicinity of theblastholes would, in a little time, become a seriousinconvcnience. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e By experiment I have discovered that, by-insertng an open pipe similar to that shown at D, I can almost, ii' not perfectly, obviatc and correct all of these diii'iculties. This pipe is flattened at its upper end, so as t0 present the form of a narrow slot, extending between the ridges F F, and parallel withthem, and nearly or quite as long as therslots O O.' From thence itdescends through the air-chambervl, and opens beneath thevforgc in some open space left for that'purpose.\\ \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e When I construct the part of the. as above described, I also make the pi made permanent and tight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operation ot this pipe will be readily'undcrstood. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e While the bellows is in operation, the currents of air, passing outward tbr against the pieces of fuel lying above them, and there willbe a slight `1eaction, of air downward through the pipe D,`and this How will be suilieient to remove alwaysaccumulate at that point. When fresh fuel Vis mixed with that which escape of gas through thesam'e duct, and the likely to injure a piece f iron placedrin the fire to heat, ofthe fire, and gas generated above it would pass olf wit plate which contains the ridges and orifices separate from the remainder, pe'D in two parts, so that the joint at theupper end of said pipe may be ongh the orifices C C, impinge suliicient to cause a slight flow dust andline ashes, which'wrill is burning, there will also be an gas which so escapes is precisely the portion'which would be most because the iron to be heated. is' placed neur the bottom hout doing injury. When the bellows ceases to operate,- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e then there is an upward current immediately established through the pipe D, because air can gain access to the \"fire more readily through said pipe than fromabove, through the eaked fuel. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e By this arrangement I secure a better heat, amore compact re, a cleaner-fire, and less inconvenience from dust and gas than can be attained by the use of any other tuyere with which I am acqnainted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is evident that the advantages of my open escape-ppe D may be obtained without adopting the wlioleof `the details of'construction which I have shown and described, andhen'ce I shouldconsider any escapewa'y having one end in communication with the fire, substantially in the manner described, and capable of conveying away the dust and lashes, while the bellows continues to operate, as above set forth, to embrace the principles et\" my invention. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving described my invention, what I claim as new, is-' l l An escape-pipe D, or its equivalent, independent of the ductwhicb conveys thevbla'st tothe fire, descending from the centre of the tuyere, to convey away ashes, dust, dic., from the bottom of the re, and to admit a direct draught when Athe bellows is not inl operation, substantially as set forth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tuyerc. constructed with the aircha`mbcr B, outlets C C, and the escape-pipe D, substantially as described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ei WM.

WARRAM, a resident of Kent county,and JAMES W. URIE, a resident of Baltimore, State of Maryland, citizens of the United States, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Nail- Placers, of which the following is a specification.  \n  Our invention relates to an improvement in nail-placers designed for attachment to any of the common forms of hammer, hatchet, or other driving implement now on the market.  \n  It often happens that carpenters and others find it necessary to drive a nail in such a position that the operator cannot use both handsthat is to say, he cannot hold the nail with one hand and use the hammer with the other hand. Consequently itis common practice to hold the hammer-head in the palm of the hand and the nail between the first and second fingers at a point midway between the first and second joints thereof, the head of the nail resting against the hammer, and thus start the nail; but this practice often causes serious wounds and abrasions unless the operator is very careful. Our invention avoids this and other disadvantages by providing-a means carried by the driving implement itself for releasably retaining the nail while the driving implement is being wielded to start or stick the nail, after which the implement and its attachment are disengaged from the nail and the implement wielded -in the usual manner to drive the nail home.  \n  A further object of our invention is to provide a simple, neat, and inexpensive device of the kind set forth which may be attached to any form of hammer or other driving implement now on the market without the necessity of providing a special form of hammer-head, as has previously been the case.  \n  Our invention also consists in certain novel details of construction and combinations of parts, such as will be more fully described hereinafter and particularly pointed out in the claim.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a view in side elevation of our invention applied to a hatchet. Fig. 2 is an enlarged perspective of the attachment, and Fig. 3 is a top plan view of Fig. 1.  \n  A indicates the head of the driving implement, which in the present instance is a hatchet, and B is the usual helve\u0026#39;or handle to which the head is secured, the latter being provided with the customary projecting face 1. The helve or handle passes through the eye of the head and at its upper end may be flush with the head in the usual manner. To this end of the helve is secured a combined stop and retaining block or abutment 2, which in the present instance is in the form of a right triangle, the base of which rests upon the end of the handle and projects therebeyond to overlie the surrounding portion of the head A of the driving-tool, thereby preventing the head from flying off of the bandle. The squared end of the stop-block lies nearest the face 1 of the head, and this end is provided with a recess or indentation 3, forming a seat for the reception of the nail-head. Superimposed upon the outer surface of the block is a retaining resilient member 4, the rear end of which conforms to the slope of the surface of the block, which latter gradually decreases until the edge of the head is reached, thereby saving expense in material and avoiding the formation of a projection at that end which would interfere with the proper operation of the device. Nails, screws, or other suitable fasteningdevices 5 5 pass through the rear end of the spring member and through the block 2 into the end of the handle B to retain the attachment in position as well as to spread the handle to cause it .to frictionally engage the eye to prevent the accidental separation of the head and handle. The free end of the spring member is slightly curved trans abutment and being engaged and frictionalljv I held in position by the spring. The operator then grasps the handle B and swings the implement to the point where it is desired to drive the nail. A smart blow will stick the nail firmly in position, whereupon the drivinghead is disengaged from the nail and the tool used in the obvious manner to drive the nail home.  \n  Our device does not require a special form of head, nor is it desirable that a particular form of head be especially made, as heretofore; but, on the contrary, the invention can be applied to any of the usual or common forms of driving-tools now on the market with no change thereof, and, furthermore, the device is adapted to be used with any style of fastening means from tacks to twenty-penny nails. A further advantage resides in the fact that the attachment does not project beyond the sides or the vertical planes of the sides of the head, thus permitting its use in connection with hatchets, axes, or other cutting means, since the placer will not interfere with the passage of the tool through a log of wood,forinstance, and, further,when attached to a claw-hammer the additional height afforded by the device gives an increased and highly-advantageous leverage, since it pro vides a fulcrum upon which to rock the tool 3 in withdrawing nails, tacks, and the like.  \n  It will be evident that our invention is susceptible of many changes and alterations from the form and arrangement herein described without departing from the spirit and scope 35 thereof, and hence we do not wish to limit ourselves to the exact construction herein set forth; but,  \n  Having thus fully disclosed our invention, what we claim as new, and desire to secure by 14 Letters Patent, is  \n  The combination, with a driving implement and a handle therefor, of a nail-placer comprising an abutment and a retaining member superimposed thereupon, the abutment located upon the outer end of the handle and extending over and lying upon the driving implement to prevent the latter from starting from the handle, and fastening means passing through the retainer and abutment and into the handle.  \n  In testimony whereof We have signed our names to this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \n WILLIAM H.

GILGEN, a citizen of the United States, residing in Passaic, in the county of Passaic and State of New Jersey, have invented a certain new and useful Improvement in Telephone Systems, of which the following is a specification.  \n  The invention relates to that class of telephone systems in which a central station is [O dispensed with and each subscriber is enabled to call and communicate directly with any other subscriber on the system.  \n  The object of the invention is to provide a simple arrangement of centrally-energized 5 calling and talking circuits forming a system in which the necessity for complicated selecting devices is avoided and which shall be noninductive and of high efficiency.  \n The invention consists in the arrangement of circuits and location therein of calling, transmitting, and receiving devices by which the above objects are attained, to be hereinafter described.  \n The accompanying drawing forms a part 5 of this specification and shows diagrammatically a system of four stations and the circuits therefor.  \n  The stations are for convenience designated by the numerals 1, 2, 3, and A, from left to 3 right, and are all similarly equipped and wired. Stations 1 and 2 are shown as conditioned for talking, and 3 and A are normal or temporarily idle and conditioned for calling. There may be any number of stations similarly connected. Each station is equipped with a transmitter, receiver, call-bell, and a return signal or alarm, which will be described as a buzzer to distinguish it from the bell, also a receiver hook or switch and four jacks,  \n  one for each station, all of which may be of any ordinary or approved types. The transmitters are marked A, A A and A, the receivers B B \u0026amp;c., the bells C C (520., the buzzers D D 850., and the hooks E E 860.  \n  The jacks for station 1 are marked F, F F  \n and F*; for station 2 G G \u0026amp;c., and for stations 3 and A H and l. with corresponding supernumerals. The battery is of two cells or series of cells M M. The negative-pole electrodes of both are connected to a single wire 5 N, indicated by the minus sign and each positive-pole electrode to a separate wire, indicated by the plus sign such independent wires being marked N and N, respectively.  \n A wire 0 leads from the wire N at station 1 to the bell O, and from the bell a wire 0\u0026#34; leads to a contact-point c with the hook E when the latter is depressed or normal. A wire b leads from the negative wire N to the receiver B, and from the latter extends a wire I) to a contact Z2, broken when the hook is depressed.  \n A wire (1 leads from the positive wire N to the transmitter A and thence by wire a to a permanent connection with the hook.  \n  J J J and J are spring contact-pieces, 5 one at each station in contact each with its hook, arranged to break such contact when the hook is in the normal or depressed position and when thus broken to make contact with the several contact-points D\u0026#34;, D, D and 7 D through shunt-circuits with the wires 7/ 6 \u0026amp;c., such contact being broken when the spring contact-pieces are lifted by the raising of the hooks. From each spring contact-piece a wire Kat station 1, for GXIII1DlQ-COD- nects to one arm of each jack F F, \u0026amp;c., of that series, and each station is similarly equipped with such wires, (marked, respectively, K K and 1?.) The opposite arms of the jacks of each series are connected to those of all the other series bearing the same supernumerals by line-wires L, L L and L\u0026#34; and by wires f,f f and f\u0026#34; for the first series, 9 \u0026amp;c., for the second station, and  \n 72, and t, with same supernumerals, for sta- 5 tions 3 and A, respectively, and from the hook at each station a permanently-connected wire,  \n as E E, \u0026amp;c., leads to such opposite arm of the jack hearing as a supernumeral the number of the station, as at station 3 the wire E 9 leads to the jack H Having thus indicated the wiring and equipment, it remains to follow the circuits under the several conditions as developed in practice. The bell-circuit will be first described,  \n and will be more easily followed by referring to stations 3 and 4 in the diagram. Supposing station 3 to call station 4, the caller inserts the plug indicated by the dotted circle at U into the jack H and thus completes a circuit beginning, for convenience of description, at the positive wire N, through the wire 0\u0026#34; to the bell C at station 4, through 0 to hook E, thence through wires E and 1;\u0026#34; to line-wire L, to wire it and jack H at station 3, thence by Wire K to spring contact-piece J and shunt D and buzzer D to wire 7), between the receiver and battery, and to the negative-pole wire N of the battery, thus ringing bell C at the called station 1 and buzzer D at the calling-station 3. The buzzers are preferably without commutators and vibrate in unison with the bells. It will be observed that a connection exists between the hook E through the wire a transmitter A\u0026#34;, and wire (0 to the wire N but as this is also positive and there fore neutral this circuit is of no effect, and as the transmitter resistance is higher than that of the bell there is no objectionable reverse action. The bell at the called station continues to ring until the hook E is released, this condition being announced at the callingstation by the cessation of the buzzer action. If station t should be busy and the hook E\u0026#34; already released at the time of call, the circuit will be incomplete at a, and neither the called bell nor the calling-buzzer will operate; but so soon as the hook E is again depressed by hanging up the receiver or otherwise the called bell will immediately ring and the calling-buzzer respond, to again cease when the called receiver is again detached and hook E allowed to rise, thus notifying the caller that station 4: is ready for talking.  \n  The talking-circuitis exemplified at stations 1 and 2. Station 1 has called station 2 by the insertion of plug U in jack F in the manner just described, and the hooks E and E are released by the parties in communication, the bell-circuit being broken. Beginning at the positive-pole wire through wire a at station 1, transmitter A and wire (L5 to hook E, thence through spring contact-piece Jand wire K, through plug U and jack F and wire f to line L and wire g at station 2, wire E, hook E wire 7) to receiver B thence by wire 6 to negative wire N, thus completing the circuit. The wire a (6 in which the transmitter A is located, is ineffective, because it leads to the wire N which is also positive. The circuit from the positive-pole wire 1 2 through wire rt and transmitter A at station 2, through the line L to the receiver B at station 1, and negative-pole wire N is in all respects similar.  \n  The local path ofl\u0026#39;ered at each of the two stations 1 and 2 from the positive-pole wire N through each local transmitter, hook, and receiver to the negative-pole wire N does not interfere with the action of the transmitter,  \n because although the current divides between the receivers at the two talking-stations it passes unobstructedly through the transmitter before such division takes place. By reason of this arrangement the transmitter is rendered antisidc tone and capable of efiicient service in noisy situations, as against the common arrangement in which the transmitters and receivers are in series, the resistance of such receivers affecting the transmission. The transmitter at station 1 is in direct series with the receiver at station 2, with no resistance in the circuit other than that of the linewire. The same is true of any tWo stations in either direction. The wire leading from the hook at each station to the correspondinglynumbered jack is continued to the similarlynumbered line-Wire and may be a direct connection between such hook and wire, omitting such jack. The advantage in the connection to the jack, as shown, is that by inserting the plug in the home-station jack the subscriber may ring his own bell, and thus test the conditions at his own station.  \n  It will be noted that the transmitter of the transmitting-station is in series with the receiver at the receiving-station a condition conducive to the attainment of the highest degree of erficiency.  \n  The system is non-inductive by reason of the normally closed transmitter-circuit, the induced currents traversing the lowresistance circuitand avoiding the higher-resistance path-that is to say, induction is not neutralized through methods of transposition or crossing of wires, but is nullified on the receiver-circuit, because it is shunted by the low-resistance closed transmitter-circuit, as the induced current traverses the positive pole of the battery-circuit and through both transmitters making a same-pole closed circuit. The negative pole of the battery is similar relatively to the receivers, although the latter are of higher resistance than the former (the transmitter) circuit. For the purposes of this description 1 Will assume that the transmitter resistance is thirty ohms, the receiver one hundred ohms, and the bell and buzzer each two ohms. For example, the receiver-circuit (two hundred ohms,) as will be observed, has a closed path along the negative batterywire, which places the two receivers in series with the negative battery-wire and the line, and the transmitter-circuit (sixty ohms) is parallel with the above, but uses the positive batteryconductor and the line and offers only about one fourth the resistance, thus serving as a shunt to the receiver-circuit for carrying induced currents.  \n  The arrangement of the bell-circuit and its contacts with the spring contact-piece and hook produces an automatic ringing without requiring the holding down of a push-button or an analogous device, and on the release of the hook at either the called or calling station the ringing of both bell and buzzer ceases.  \n  It will be understood that any number of stations may be connected, the four shown being selected merely for convenience of illustration and description.  \n  Any form of receiver-hook or suitable switch will serve successfully and the contactpieces J J \u0026amp;c., and points D D, \u0026amp;c., may be of any suitable construction adapted to make and break the circuits as required.  \n I claim 1.

GILGEN, a citizen of the United States, residing in Passaic, in the county of Passaic and State of New Jersey, have invented a certain new and useful Improvement in Telephone Systems, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The invention relates to that class of telephone systems in which a central station is [O dispensed with and each subscriber is enabled to call and communicate directly with any other subscriber on the system. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The object of the invention is to provide a simple arrangement of centrally-energized 5 calling and talking circuits forming a system in which the necessity for complicated selecting devices is avoided and which shall be noninductive and of high efficiency. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe invention consists in the arrangement of circuits and location therein of calling, transmitting, and receiving devices by which the above objects are attained, to be hereinafter described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accompanying drawing forms a part 5 of this specification and shows diagrammatically a system of four stations and the circuits therefor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The stations are for convenience designated by the numerals 1, 2, 3, and A, from left to 3 right, and are all similarly equipped and wired. Stations 1 and 2 are shown as conditioned for talking, and 3 and A are normal or temporarily idle and conditioned for calling. There may be any number of stations similarly connected. Each station is equipped with a transmitter, receiver, call-bell, and a return signal or alarm, which will be described as a buzzer to distinguish it from the bell, also a receiver hook or switch and four jacks, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e one for each station, all of which may be of any ordinary or approved types. The transmitters are marked A, A A and A, the receivers B B \u0026amp;c., the bells C C (520., the buzzers D D 850., and the hooks E E 860. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The jacks for station 1 are marked F, F F \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand F*; for station 2 G G \u0026amp;c., and for stations 3 and A H and l. with corresponding supernumerals. The battery is of two cells or series of cells M M. The negative-pole electrodes of both are connected to a single wire 5 N, indicated by the minus sign and each positive-pole electrode to a separate wire, indicated by the plus sign such independent wires being marked N and N, respectively. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wire 0 leads from the wire N at station 1 to the bell O, and from the bell a wire 0\" leads to a contact-point c with the hook E when the latter is depressed or normal. A wire b leads from the negative wire N to the receiver B, and from the latter extends a wire I) to a contact Z2, broken when the hook is depressed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wire (1 leads from the positive wire N to the transmitter A and thence by wire a to a permanent connection with the hook. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e J J J and J are spring contact-pieces, 5 one at each station in contact each with its hook, arranged to break such contact when the hook is in the normal or depressed position and when thus broken to make contact with the several contact-points D\", D, D and 7 D through shunt-circuits with the wires 7/ 6 \u0026amp;c., such contact being broken when the spring contact-pieces are lifted by the raising of the hooks. From each spring contact-piece a wire Kat station 1, for GXIII1DlQ-COD- nects to one arm of each jack F F, \u0026amp;c., of that series, and each station is similarly equipped with such wires, (marked, respectively, K K and 1?.) The opposite arms of the jacks of each series are connected to those of all the other series bearing the same supernumerals by line-wires L, L L and L\" and by wires f,f f and f\" for the first series, 9 \u0026amp;c., for the second station, and \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e72, and t, with same supernumerals, for sta- 5 tions 3 and A, respectively, and from the hook at each station a permanently-connected wire, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas E E, \u0026amp;c., leads to such opposite arm of the jack hearing as a supernumeral the number of the station, as at station 3 the wire E 9 leads to the jack H Having thus indicated the wiring and equipment, it remains to follow the circuits under the several conditions as developed in practice. The bell-circuit will be first described, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand will be more easily followed by referring to stations 3 and 4 in the diagram. Supposing station 3 to call station 4, the caller inserts the plug indicated by the dotted circle at U into the jack H and thus completes a circuit beginning, for convenience of description, at the positive wire N, through the wire 0\" to the bell C at station 4, through 0 to hook E, thence through wires E and 1;\" to line-wire L, to wire it and jack H at station 3, thence by Wire K to spring contact-piece J and shunt D and buzzer D to wire 7), between the receiver and battery, and to the negative-pole wire N of the battery, thus ringing bell C at the called station 1 and buzzer D at the calling-station 3. The buzzers are preferably without commutators and vibrate in unison with the bells. It will be observed that a connection exists between the hook E through the wire a transmitter A\", and wire (0 to the wire N but as this is also positive and there fore neutral this circuit is of no effect, and as the transmitter resistance is higher than that of the bell there is no objectionable reverse action. The bell at the called station continues to ring until the hook E is released, this condition being announced at the callingstation by the cessation of the buzzer action. If station t should be busy and the hook E\" already released at the time of call, the circuit will be incomplete at a, and neither the called bell nor the calling-buzzer will operate; but so soon as the hook E is again depressed by hanging up the receiver or otherwise the called bell will immediately ring and the calling-buzzer respond, to again cease when the called receiver is again detached and hook E allowed to rise, thus notifying the caller that station 4: is ready for talking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The talking-circuitis exemplified at stations 1 and 2. Station 1 has called station 2 by the insertion of plug U in jack F in the manner just described, and the hooks E and E are released by the parties in communication, the bell-circuit being broken. Beginning at the positive-pole wire through wire a at station 1, transmitter A and wire (L5 to hook E, thence through spring contact-piece Jand wire K, through plug U and jack F and wire f to line L and wire g at station 2, wire E, hook E wire 7) to receiver B thence by wire 6 to negative wire N, thus completing the circuit. The wire a (6 in which the transmitter A is located, is ineffective, because it leads to the wire N which is also positive. The circuit from the positive-pole wire 1 2 through wire rt and transmitter A at station 2, through the line L to the receiver B at station 1, and negative-pole wire N is in all respects similar. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The local path ofl'ered at each of the two stations 1 and 2 from the positive-pole wire N through each local transmitter, hook, and receiver to the negative-pole wire N does not interfere with the action of the transmitter, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause although the current divides between the receivers at the two talking-stations it passes unobstructedly through the transmitter before such division takes place. By reason of this arrangement the transmitter is rendered antisidc tone and capable of efiicient service in noisy situations, as against the common arrangement in which the transmitters and receivers are in series, the resistance of such receivers affecting the transmission. The transmitter at station 1 is in direct series with the receiver at station 2, with no resistance in the circuit other than that of the linewire. The same is true of any tWo stations in either direction. The wire leading from the hook at each station to the correspondinglynumbered jack is continued to the similarlynumbered line-Wire and may be a direct connection between such hook and wire, omitting such jack. The advantage in the connection to the jack, as shown, is that by inserting the plug in the home-station jack the subscriber may ring his own bell, and thus test the conditions at his own station. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be noted that the transmitter of the transmitting-station is in series with the receiver at the receiving-station a condition conducive to the attainment of the highest degree of erficiency. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The system is non-inductive by reason of the normally closed transmitter-circuit, the induced currents traversing the lowresistance circuitand avoiding the higher-resistance path-that is to say, induction is not neutralized through methods of transposition or crossing of wires, but is nullified on the receiver-circuit, because it is shunted by the low-resistance closed transmitter-circuit, as the induced current traverses the positive pole of the battery-circuit and through both transmitters making a same-pole closed circuit. The negative pole of the battery is similar relatively to the receivers, although the latter are of higher resistance than the former (the transmitter) circuit. For the purposes of this description 1 Will assume that the transmitter resistance is thirty ohms, the receiver one hundred ohms, and the bell and buzzer each two ohms. For example, the receiver-circuit (two hundred ohms,) as will be observed, has a closed path along the negative batterywire, which places the two receivers in series with the negative battery-wire and the line, and the transmitter-circuit (sixty ohms) is parallel with the above, but uses the positive batteryconductor and the line and offers only about one fourth the resistance, thus serving as a shunt to the receiver-circuit for carrying induced currents. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The arrangement of the bell-circuit and its contacts with the spring contact-piece and hook produces an automatic ringing without requiring the holding down of a push-button or an analogous device, and on the release of the hook at either the called or calling station the ringing of both bell and buzzer ceases. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be understood that any number of stations may be connected, the four shown being selected merely for convenience of illustration and description. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Any form of receiver-hook or suitable switch will serve successfully and the contactpieces J J \u0026amp;c., and points D D, \u0026amp;c., may be of any suitable construction adapted to make and break the circuits as required. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI claim 1.

WAGKMAN, of,A uburn, in the county of Cayuga, and State of New York,  \n have invented certain new and useful mprovements in Machinery for Sharpening Harvester-Cutters, of which the following is afull, cleara nd exact description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, which make part of thisspecication, and in which--` Figure 1 represents a plan or top view of a machine to which my improvements are applied.  \n Figure 2 represents a view in elevation of one side of the same, an\u0026#39;d l Figure 3 represents o. similar view of thesame, as seen From one end.  \n  Figure 4 represents a transverse central section, through a stone\u0026#39;7 of a modified form., showing another way in which the section nearestthe eye ot`. the cutter-bar may be sharpened.  \n I Figure\u0026#39; represents \u0026#39;a similar section through my improved stone, showiiig the way\u0026#39;in which I prefer to\u0026#39; grind the knives. A  \n The rst branch oi\u0026#39; my invention relates to the clamp-rrame in which vthe cutters are h\u0026#39;eld while beingsharpened, and this part of my invention consists in combiningwith a grindstone an adjstable clamping-frame, suspended from overhanging arms, whereby the cutters can be presented to the stone at any desired angle.  \n  The next part of my invention consists in so constructing the oscillating overhanging frame that it may readily be attached to or removed from the frame of the grindstone, whereby the machine is rendered portable.  \n  The next part of my invention consistsin combining with an overhanging grindstone, having its supports pivoted so as to allow it to turn, a\u0026#39;n adjustable suspended oscillating clamp-frame, whereby great facility in grinding cutters of different angles is secured.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, which show all my improvements as embodiedin one machine, and exem plify one practical way of carrying out my invention,  \n A stout frame, A, is shown, as supported on legs a.  \n  The grindstone E is mounted on one end of a shaft, D, turning in suitable bearings \u0026#39;in\u0026#39; a bracket or standard, C, and driven by a crank, or in any other well-known way. This standard CV is mounted on a bed-plate, B,\u0026#39;which rests upon the frame A, to which it is clamped by a set-screw, b\u0026#39;, passing through a slot, b, in the bed-plate, and forming a pivot, on which the bed-plate may be turned horizontally, to vary the angle of the face of the stone relatively to the frame. I am aware, however, that a stone mounted in a frame, turning on\u0026#39; a pivot, is not new.\u0026#39; A water-trough, F, is also mounted on the bed-plate B.  \n  The grindstone, as shown in iig. 5, is constructed with its sides bevelled near the periphery, at an angle. The cutters are ground on this bevelled part of the stone. When the bevelled edge of the cutter-section lies flat against or parallel with the grinding-surface, asit does when being sharpened, the cutter-bar is presented at such an angle to the side of the stone that\u0026#39;thc eye of the cutter-bar projects beyond the stone, and is thus prevented from striking it. This obviates what has heretofore proved tobe a serious obstacle to the success of this class ci machines.  \n  In order to adapt the stone to cutters ci different angles of bevelling, I form a cent-ral depression, e2, in the side of the stone, as shown in iig. 5. vThis depression allows the eye of the cntter-bar to pass within the plane of the stone, if desired.  \n  I have illustrated this idea more fully in fig. 4, which showsa modified form of the stone. In this figure a central boss is shown, leaving an annular groove, el, of a width and depth sufficient to admit the entire eye \u0026#39;within the plane of the stone, if necessary. I generally, however, prefer to apply the cutter-bar to the stone at the angle shown in iig. 5, as, in that position, the eye can be moved endwise and forward without striking the stone. Y  \n  I am aware that it has been proposedto form annular grooves in the side of a griudstone, but such grooves were merely for the purpose of forming a raised band for a grinding-surface, and were not adapted to receive lthe eye of the cutter-bar, nor were they used in combination with a bevelled grindingsurface.  \n . device.  \n In iig\u0026#39;. 5, both\u0026#39;sides of the stone are shown as bevelled, and` as having central depressions.  \n  Two vertical posts, G- G\u0026#39;, are mounted in the end-timbers ofthe frame A, their lower ends being rounded, and passing through round holes in the frame. They\u0026#39;are fastened by pinspassing transversely lthrough them below the frame. The posts are thus free toturn axially in the frame.  \n  A bracket or arm, H, projects horizontallyffrom each of these posts, and has a horizontal slot, h, in it, \u0026#39;in which a journal, h1, moves. l These journals are provided with collars and jam-nuts by which they can be clamped at any desired distance from the posts GG. l  \n  From these journals arms-I are suspended, so as to, swing freely in a vertical plane, at right angles to their bearing. i The lower ends of these arms are rounded, and passfthrough corresponding holes in a rack or bar, J, and are held by prins underneath the baror in some *other propervell-known way. These arms can thus turn freely axially in-` the rack, which latter has a ilunge, j, on its loweredge, to support the cutter-ban\u0026#39; and adjustable hooked clamps c, to hold the bar on the flange.  \n  The turning-posts G G enlble the rack J to be traversed lengthwise across the side of the stone, the slotted arms H and journ\u0026#39;alsI enable it to be presented at any desired angle to the stone, and the\u0026#39; swinging arms I enable it to be swung ,towards or from the stone, thus securing an almostunlimited range of adjustment.  \n  .To hold the cutters securely against the stone while being ground, a cord \u0026#39;or wire, l, is attached to the rack, passed through `kan eye, l\u0026#39;, and attached to a treudle, L, which may be attached to the frame, or\u0026#39; rest loosely on the ground, as shown in. thegdrawings.  \n By bearing ou the treadle withhis foot, the operator draws the rack and cuttersup tothe stone, and still has his hands free to turn the crank, or to slide or hold the 4cutter\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;n\u0026#39;the rack. When one side of the cutters is ground,the cord is detached `from its fastening at\u0026#39; one end of the clamp-frame, und.l attached at the other end, that it may draw and hold the other edges against the stone. A l v 1 Jointed levers would answer a goodpurpose, but I preferafcord or wire, as the more simple und Veffectual \u0026#39;The operatiomof the machine-will readily be understood from\u0026#39; the foregoing\u0026#39;d\u0026#39;escriptioh.  \n It is manifest that the ,frame A, thebed-plate and stone, and the posts -wlxich support 4the clampframe,  \n can readily be detached from each other, andlrthat the posts and clamp-frame could rendilyvvb\u0026#39;e applied to an ordinary, grindstone, \u0026#39;and do good work. f  \n What I claim as my invention, and desire to secuiewby Letters Patent, isl 1.

Serial No. 210,850.  \n To all whom, it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, REIsoN C. WRIGHT, a citizen of the United States, residing at Colorado Springs, in the county of El Paso and State of Colorado, have invented a new and useful Sash-Fastener, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention relates to sash-locks such as are designed to lock a pair of window-sashes toeach other and to lock one of them to the window-frame.  \n  The prime object of the invention is to improve the construction of such devices by rendering them capable of being locked by a simple longitudinal movement of one locking member instead of by the compound movements which are necessary upon most prior devices of the character indicated.  \n Further objects of the invention are to\u0026#39; simplify and strengthen the construction of such devices.  \n  With these objects in View the invention resides `in the combination and arrangement of parts and in the details of\u0026#39;construction hereinafter described and claimed.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, Figure 1 is a perspective view showing the sash-fastener applied to a window-sash, and Fig.y2 is a perspective view ofthe device removed.  \n  The reference-numeral 1 indicates part of the window-frame, 2 the lower-sash, and 3 the upper sash. A series of sockets 4 is formed in the window-frame 1, a similar series 5 being formed in the upper sash 3. The sockets 5 in the upper sash are preferably formed near to the glass along the inside of the sash.  \n  Fastened in any suitable manner to the lower sash 2 is the base-plate 6 of the improved locking device. .Iournaled in lugs 7 and 8 upon the plate 6 is a locking member 9, having a crank portion 10. One end of the locking member 9 is provided with a bent portion 11, which is adapted when the member is partially rotated to engage one of the sockets 5 A in the upper sash 3. The member 9 is capable of longitudinal movement in its bearings for a purpose presently to be described. Movable longitudinally in lugslQ and 13 on the base-plate is a locking member 14, having a handle portion 15. The member 14, which is preferably at an angle to the member 9, is formed with a loop 16, that iits over the crank portion 10 ofthe member 9. The end of the member 14 opposite to the handle portion 15 is adapted \u0026#39;to fit into one of the sockets 4 in theV window-frame. A pair of uprights 17 may be placed upon the base-plate 6 on oppo- \u0026#39;similar upright 18 may be located adjacent to the member 14, as shown.  \n  Constructed as above described, the operation of the improved locking device is\u0026#39;as follows: By moving the locking member 14 forward to engage one of the sockets 4 the locking member 9 is caused simultaneously to engage lone of the sockets 5. Then by turning the locking member 14 upon its axis until the loop 16 fits over the upright 18 rearward longitudinal movement of the member 14 is prevented and both locking members are held` in locked position. The two members are unlocked by turning thev member 14 and retracting it longitudinally. It will be observed that the uprights 17 limit the rearwardturning movement of the locking member 9, thus l retaining said member always in operative position, and that when the locking member 14 is retracted the uprights 17 are upon opposite sides of the loop portion thereof, thus` preventing it from turning, and so holding it always in operative engagement with the member 9. From the foregoing explanation it will be apparent that the two locking members are operated by a longitudinal movement of one member. If it be desired to use merely the locking member 14, the locking member 9 may be moved longitudinally in its bearings until its crank portion leaves the loop of the member 14, after which it is possible to operate the member 14 without affecting the member 9.  \n  In manufacturing the device the locking menbers 9 and 14 may be made of wire, if desire The sash-lock of this invention is simple, durable, strong, and inexpensive in construction, as well as efficient in operation. In its IOO and in its details of construction it presents an improvement over prior devices of a similar character.  \n Changes in the precise embodiment of the invention illustrated and described may be.  \n . made within the scope of the following claims Without departing from the spirit of the invention.  \n  Having thus described the invention, what is claimed isl. A sash-lock including a pair of members one of which has oscillatory movement to and from locking position and the other longitudinal movement to and from locking position, said members having interengaging loop portions, whereby locking movement of the longitudinally-movable member will be transferredto the oscillatory member.  \n  2. The combination in a sash-fastener, of a pair of locking members, one of which has oscillatory movement to and from locking position, and the second member being movable longitudinally to and from locking position, interengaging loops formed on both members,  \n and means engaging one of said members lor holding both in locked position.  \n  3. A sash-lock comprising a longitudinallymovable locking member, a rotary locking member connected therewith and operated thereby, and means for holding said members against movement by turning the longitudinally-movable member.  \n  4.

WRIGHT, a citizen of the United States, residing at Colorado Springs, in the county of El Paso and State of Colorado, have invented a new and useful Sash-Fastener, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates to sash-locks such as are designed to lock a pair of window-sashes toeach other and to lock one of them to the window-frame. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The prime object of the invention is to improve the construction of such devices by rendering them capable of being locked by a simple longitudinal movement of one locking member instead of by the compound movements which are necessary upon most prior devices of the character indicated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther objects of the invention are to' simplify and strengthen the construction of such devices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e With these objects in View the invention resides `in the combination and arrangement of parts and in the details of'construction hereinafter described and claimed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, Figure 1 is a perspective view showing the sash-fastener applied to a window-sash, and Fig.y2 is a perspective view ofthe device removed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The reference-numeral 1 indicates part of the window-frame, 2 the lower-sash, and 3 the upper sash. A series of sockets 4 is formed in the window-frame 1, a similar series 5 being formed in the upper sash 3. The sockets 5 in the upper sash are preferably formed near to the glass along the inside of the sash. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Fastened in any suitable manner to the lower sash 2 is the base-plate 6 of the improved locking device. .Iournaled in lugs 7 and 8 upon the plate 6 is a locking member 9, having a crank portion 10. One end of the locking member 9 is provided with a bent portion 11, which is adapted when the member is partially rotated to engage one of the sockets 5 A in the upper sash 3. The member 9 is capable of longitudinal movement in its bearings for a purpose presently to be described. Movable longitudinally in lugslQ and 13 on the base-plate is a locking member 14, having a handle portion 15. The member 14, which is preferably at an angle to the member 9, is formed with a loop 16, that iits over the crank portion 10 ofthe member 9. The end of the member 14 opposite to the handle portion 15 is adapted 'to fit into one of the sockets 4 in theV window-frame. A pair of uprights 17 may be placed upon the base-plate 6 on oppo- 'similar upright 18 may be located adjacent to the member 14, as shown. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Constructed as above described, the operation of the improved locking device is'as follows: By moving the locking member 14 forward to engage one of the sockets 4 the locking member 9 is caused simultaneously to engage lone of the sockets 5. Then by turning the locking member 14 upon its axis until the loop 16 fits over the upright 18 rearward longitudinal movement of the member 14 is prevented and both locking members are held` in locked position. The two members are unlocked by turning thev member 14 and retracting it longitudinally. It will be observed that the uprights 17 limit the rearwardturning movement of the locking member 9, thus l retaining said member always in operative position, and that when the locking member 14 is retracted the uprights 17 are upon opposite sides of the loop portion thereof, thus` preventing it from turning, and so holding it always in operative engagement with the member 9. From the foregoing explanation it will be apparent that the two locking members are operated by a longitudinal movement of one member. If it be desired to use merely the locking member 14, the locking member 9 may be moved longitudinally in its bearings until its crank portion leaves the loop of the member 14, after which it is possible to operate the member 14 without affecting the member 9. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In manufacturing the device the locking menbers 9 and 14 may be made of wire, if desire The sash-lock of this invention is simple, durable, strong, and inexpensive in construction, as well as efficient in operation. In its IOO and in its details of construction it presents an improvement over prior devices of a similar character. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanges in the precise embodiment of the invention illustrated and described may be. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. made within the scope of the following claims Without departing from the spirit of the invention. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus described the invention, what is claimed isl.

Serial No. 163,460.  \n and FREDERICK H. ENGELHARD, citizens of the United States of America, and residents of Springfield, in the county of Hampden and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, have in-.  \n vented a new and useful Float, of which the following is a specification.  \n  Our\u0026#39;invention relates to improvements in floats for valves in which sheet-copper sections are joined and reinforced by certain peculiar means, as hereinafter described. Heretofore it has been customary to make floatballs, column-floats, and the like, which are generally designated hereinafter by the\u0026#39;common term float, in sections that are semispherical or otherwise, according to the style or kind of float, and to connect said sections by various kinds of joints, which have often been expensive to construct and proven weak and unsatisfactory. Various ineffectual and inadequate devices have also been employed to reinforce floats for the purpose of strengthening them.  \n  Our invention provides for a float construction which possesses the necessary advantages and is free from the objections noted.  \n  The object of our improvement is to produce aseamless float which is light and durable and of such strength as to resist the pressure or heat to which it is likely to be subjected without collapsing or having the efliciency of its joint impaired.  \n . A further object of our invention is to provide adequate reinforcement for a float at its weakest portions. Our floats are also symmetrical and of a proper and uniform weight, such weight, however, being usually less than has heretofore been required, owing to the fact that we are able to use a very light material in the construction without sacrificing strength. IVe provide, too, for tight and secure nipple and pipe joints.  \n  WVe attain these objects by the means illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view and partial section of a float-ball embodying our invention; Fig. 2, a side view of a column-float also embodyfor attaching the nipple thereto; Fig. 4, a bottom view of the same; and Fig. 5, a sectional view of a float-ball, showing means for forming joints between it and a pipe which extends therethrough.  \n Similar letters refer to similar parts throughout the several views.  \n  Our float consists, essentially, of sections, generally two in number, having an internal ring soldered thereto adjacent the abutting edges thereof, an external band of metal deposited over and around the outside of the joint between the two sections, and plating material deposited upon the outside over all. In some cases additional bands of metal may be deposited around the outside in various directions. The sections are spun out of sheetcopper in the usual and well-known manner, and the ring and deposits are of the same metal.  \n  Referring to Fig. 1, a ball-float is shown comprising the semispherical copper sections a a, having their edges abutting at 7). A copper ring 0 is soldered to the sections ainside, adjacent to, and above and below the edges which abut at Z). A copper band (Z is deposited on the sections a in a similar location as the ring 0, except that it is on the outside. A thin coating 0, of copper, is deposited all over the outside of the sections a and the band (Z. The ring 0 and the band d serve in the triple capacity of tightly binding the sections a together, of preventing collapsing at the joint, and of protecting the solder which holds the ring 0 in place, so that the joint thus formed becomes the strongest part of the float. Very thin metal for the sections a may be used with this means of connection, and the external plating or coating not only unites the parts into a homogeneous mass, as it were, but serves to even up inequalities in the outside surface and to bring the float up to the proper weight. The great heat to which the float is sometimes subjected may tend to loosen the solder which holds the ring 0 in place; but in this event no leakage at the joint or rupture of the same can occur owing to the presence of the band (Z and the external coating. Moreover, such band and coating serve to protect the solder from heat or to lessen its effect thereon. The ring and band may usually be of about the same thickness as the sections and will vary in width according to the size of the float and the strength required.  \n  The column-float shown in Fig. 2 comprises two sections a, as before, except that their semispherical ends are continued to form cylindrical bodies, the joint between which is formed in precisely the same manner as already described. In addition to the central or connecting band (Z two other like bands may be deposited on this float at and around the junctions of the semispherical and cylindrical portions, which next to the place of joining are under ordinary circumstances the weakest parts of the device. The external coating 6 is deposited over all of the bands and the intervening portions of the sections.  \n  The external surface of the ball-float may be provided with additional bands (Z when the nature of the case demands, such additional bands extending parallel with the one at the joint or in other directions. The exterior of the float shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is divided into two parts by the band around the joint, and each half so formed is halved by additional bands. The band or hands cl are applied after coating the float to the proper depth with wax or other suitable substance and leaving a strip or strips of the proper width around the abutting edges of the sections and elsewhere, if needed, clear, the copper being deposited by electroplating in the channel or channels thus formed. The wax must of course be removed beforethe final plating or coating is applied.  \n  A nipple f may be connected with the float in the usual manner-that is, with its flangeg on the inside of one of the sections, or the flange may be located upon the outside of the section and held in position by the coating 6, which surrounds and covers the same,as shown in Figs. 3 and i. By this last arrangement and construction an absolutely tight joint between the float and nipple is formed and a convenient means of attachment provided. In the present construction the auxiliary bands cZ assist in holding the flange g in place; but this is not always necessary, as reliance may be placed solely on the coating 0.  \n  It is to be understood that the joint between the sections in each of the floats shown in the drawings is in all essential particulars like the one described in detail.  \n  Our improved construction aflords an efficient means of obtaining tight and secure joints between afloat and a pipe which extends through the same, such a pipe being shown at h in Fig. 5. The jointsz\u0026#39; c\u0026#39;around the pipe 72/ on opposite sides of the float are provided by thickening the deposit or coating 0 at these points.  \n  The process by which the bands d are deposited on the sections a and the coating 0 on said sections and bands in all cases in reality incorporates the parts one with another, the copper which forms said bands entering the pores of the copper of which the sections consist and the copper deposit or coating entering the copper of both the bands and sections, all resulting in a seamless float of great strength and resistance. The bands and coating bind the parts firmly and securely together and absolutely prevent the opening of the joint, holding the same against a tendency to break apart on account of the expansion due to inside air-pressure and of the expansion of the inside ring.  \n  Our invention is applicable to other shapes of floats besides those shown. Hence We do not wish-to be restricted in this respect, but seek to include any jointed sheet-metal float or similar device. Copper, however, is believed to be the only practical metal for the purposes of this invention.  \n  What we claim as our invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. As a new article of manufacture, a float having sections arranged with their edges abutting without extension or overlap, an ex ternal band deposited over and around the joint so formed, an additional external band or bands deposited upon said sections, each band intersecting another band, and a coating or deposit upon the outside of the sections and bands.  \n  2. As a new article of manufacture, a float comprising sections semispherical and cylindrical in shape and arranged with their edges abutting without extension or overlap, an external band deposited over and around the joint so formed, and additional external bands deposited around the sections where the semispherical and cylindrical portions meet, and a coating or deposit upon the outside of the sections and bands.  \n  3. The combination with a float having an exterior coating deposited thereon, of anipple held to the outside of said float by said coating.  \n  4:. The combination with a float having external bands and an exterior coating deposited over all, of a flanged nipple held to said float by said bands and coating.  \n  In testimony whereof we have signed our names to this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \n FRANK ENGELHARD.  \n  FREDERICK H.

Y.  \n \u0026#39; FlLlVl-FERFORATING MACHINE.  \n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 788,851, dated May 2, 1905.  \n Application filed December 15, 1904- Serial No. 236,940.  \n To all whom it may concern.- 7  \n  Be it known that I, EBERHARD SCHNEIDER, a citizen of Germany, residing at New York city, (Manhattan,) county and State of New York, have invented new and useful Improvements in Film-Perforating Machines, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention relates to a machine more particularly designed for perforating the films of moving-picture exhibitors, though the machine may also be used for perforating other articles.  \n My machine is so constructed that the film is intermittently advancedin a uniform manner, that any dead movement of the feeding mechanism is avoided, and that the film is positively locked during its periods of rest, when the operation of the plungcrs takes place, so that a perfect product having uniformlyspaced perforations is obtained.  \n  in the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a side elevation of my improved film-perforating machine; Fig. 2, a left-hand end elevation thereof; Fig. 3, a vertical cross-section on line 3 3, Fig. 1, with part of the frame omitted; Fig. 4:, a detail of the table, presserfoot, and punches; Fig. r, a detail of part of the adjustable rail; Fig. 5, a detail of the pindrum and coupling; Fig. 5, a longitudinal section through a modification of the drum; Fig. 6, a detail of the adjustable countershaft bearings; Fig. 7, a cross-section on line 7 7, Fig. 6; Fig. 8, a detail of a modification of the punches, and Figs. 9 to 19 show films provided with differently-arranged perforations.  \n  The letter (0 represents the bed-plate of the machine, from which rise the bearings a of a driving-shaft b, which is designed to feed the film and also to operate the punches. The shaft t carries a pulley Z) and fly-wheel 6 and is so coupled to the film-feeding mechanism that any wear of the shaft or its hearings will not injuriously affect the true feed movement of the film. To obtain this result, shaft 6 is provided with a disk 6 having a wrist-pin b. This pin engages a slot 0 of a disk 0 which is carried by a counter-shaft a, mounted in alinement with shaft 6. Counter-shaft c is journaled in adjustable eccentric bearings 0 rotatably fitted in circular openings of uprights a (1. Figs. 6 and 7. In order to adjust the bearings 0 and lock them in position, they are provided with flanges 0*, having curved slots o These slots are engaged by set-screws 0, tapped into uprights (1, (0. Upon counter-shaft e is mounted one member (Z of a Geneva movement, having pin d, which is adapted to engage the slots a of the second member a of said movement, which is mounted on spindle 0 By the means described the continuous rotation of shaft t is converted into an intermittent rotatory movement of spindle 0 while the engagement of the curved portions of the members (Z c positively locks spindle against movement between its periods of rotation. The adjustability of bearings 0 permits an accurate engagement to be effected between the members (Z a, thus avoiding any dead motion. Upon spindle e is mounted a pinion a, engaging a large gearwheel f. This wheel is provided with a curved slot f\u0026#34;, engaged by a set-screw g of a hub keyed at 7 to a spindle g. f of\u0026#34;wheel f projects over the edge of hub Fig. 5, and holds the parts in axial aline ment\u0026#39; The spindle g is journaled in the uprights a (t and extends laterally beyond upright (4. Upon this extension is rigidly mounted a feed or pin drum )l/ for imparting the intermittent movement to the film A. This film is provided with a number of perforations by means of\u0026#39;the punches hereinafterdescribed, and these perforations are engaged by the pins 71/ of drum [1 such pins being arranged to conform to the position of the perforations. Thus it will be seen that by the means described the Geneva movement intermittently locks positively the spindle e and that the spindle in turn intermittently locks positively the pindrum it. Further, by means of the adjustable connection between gear-wheel fand hub an accurate adjustment between the Geneva movement and the pins of the pin-d rum 70 may be effected, so that the pins may be properly alined with the perforations in the film which have been previously produced by the punches.  \n  The film passes from a suitable deliveryreel (not shown) over a table 2\u0026#39;, against which The rim it is held by a presser-foot j, pivoted at y\u0026#34; to side rails z\u0026#34; of table 2\u0026#39;. These rails are laterally adjustable by means of a slot d in the rails engaged by setscrews i which are tapped into the table. A spring f holds the free end of presser-foot 1\u0026#39; down, and thereby prevents the film A from being raised off the table by the ascent of the punches B B. These punches pass through perforations f of presser-foot j, through the film, and into perforations k of a matrix In, countersunk into table 1\u0026#39;, Fig. 4E. The severed particles of the film are ejected through chute Z. After clearing the punches B B the film, being now perforated, is engaged by the feed-drum it, such drum being journaled back of table iand and matrix k, Fig. 2. The film is held against the feed-drum by a roller m and is carried by the drum to a suitable receiving-reel. (Not shown.)  \n  The drawings illustrate two sets of punches B B, of which the punches B are adapted to make perforations A along the edges of the film or at the sides of the image-receiving spaces, while the punches B are adapted to make perforations A within the body of the film or between the image-receiving spaces.  \n It is obvious, however, that either set of punches may be omitted and the machine be worked with but a single set. H eretofore it was usual to feed the film by the side perforations A only, which were either arranged in close proximity, as in Fig. 9, or farther apart, as in Fig. 19, one hole being formed in the latter case in alinement with the center of each image; but these side perforations are objectionable for a number of reasons, the principal ones being that they readily tear out and that they reduce the width of the film area available for the reception of the images. By forming the perforations A between each pair of adjoining images and at a distance from the edges of the film these objections are overcome, the life of the film is increased, and a wider panorama may be exhibited. Figs. 9 and 19 represent a film A, having side perforations A only. Figs. 10 to 12 show the side perforations A used in conjunction with different numbers of body-perforations A Fig. 11 illustrating the particular film made by the machine represented in the drawings. Figs. 15 to 15 represent films with body-perforations A only, while Figs. 16 to 18 repre sent films having spaced side perforations A in conjunction with diflerent numbers of bodyperforations A The means for operating the punches are as follows: Upon shaft?) is mounted an eccentric b engaged by a strap a. This strap is connected by a rod 91 to the lever 0 of a rock-shaft 0, journaled in .bearings a, so that each rotation of shaft I) will cause one complete oscillation of shaft 0. Shaft 0 has an arm 0 engaging a link 1), which is pivoted at 5 p to a cross-head g.  \n This cross-head carries the plungers q of the punches B, such plungers being movable in tubular guides (1 The machine is so timed that the punches engage the film while the feed-drum b is at rest, when it is locked in position by the engagement of the curved sections of the Geneva movement.  \n  The punches B will descend once between each movement of the feed-drum, while the punches B should descend once-say after each fourth movement of such drum so as to clear the image-receiving spaces. This movement is imparted to the punches B in the following manner: Shaft Z) carries a pinion 6, meshing into a large gear-wheel r, having wrist-pin 1\u0026#39;. To this pin is connected one end of a rod 8, the other end of which is connected to the lever 25 of a tubular rockshaft 1., which is fitted loosely upon rockshaft 0. Shaft 25 has an arm t engaging a link u, which is pivoted at u to cross-head o. This cross-head carries the plungers o of punches B, the plungers being movable in tubular guides 41 The proportion of the wheels 5 r is shown to be such that the plungers n will descend once at each fourth rotation of shaft 6; but these proportions may manifestly be varied.  \n  If desired, the machine can be so constructed that different sets of punches may be operated by the same pair of plungers o. In this way the same machine may be used for forming all the various perforations illustrated in the drawings by attaching to the plungers o the particular set of punches desired. To obtain this result, the lower ends of the plungers o are mortised for the reception of pins 20, projecting from a plate 20, Fig. 8, which car ries the punch 102 or the set of punches de sired. The plate 20 is secured to the plungers o by set-screws 20 so that the plate may be readily removed and replaced by a plate carrying a different arrangement of punches.  \n  The pins h of feed-drum h must correspond in position to the perforations made in the film by the punches. Thus if the punches B are used the pins it are set near the edges of drum it, Fig. 5, while when the punches B are used without punches B the pins h are set back, as shown in Fig. 5*.  \n  It is desirable that the drum 72. may be so turned that its pins h are brought into accurate engagement with the perforations A or A of film A. This adjustment is caused by slacking screw 9, changing the relative positions between hub g and wheel f, and then reclamping the hub to the wheel. In this way the position of drum It may be changed with relation to that of wheel f, and consequently to that of the driving-shaft.  \n  What I claim is 1. In a film-perforating machine, the combination of a driving-shaft with a first member of a Geneva movement actuated thereby, a second member of said movement engaging the first member, a pinion actuated by the second member, a gear-Wheel engaging the pinion, a hub adjustably secured to the gear- Wheel, a spindle carrying the hub, a pin-drum mounted on the spindle, and a punch, substantially as specified.  \n  2. in a film-perforating machine, the combination of a driving-shaft having a Wrist-pin, With a counter-shaft having aslotted disk engaged by said pin, a first member of a Geneva movement mounted on the counter-shaft, a second member of said movement engaging the first member, a pinion actuated by the second member, a gear-Wheel engaging the pinion, a hub adjustably secured to the gear- Wheel, a spindle carrying the hub, a pin-drum mounted on the spindle, and a punch, substantially as specified.  \n 3. In a film-perforating machine, the combination of a driving-shaft, With a countershaft coupled thereto, adjustable bearings for supporting the counter-shaft, a first member of a Geneva movement mounted on the counter-shaft, asecond member of said movement engaged by the first member, a pin-drum operatively connected to said second member, and a punch, substantially as specified.  \n  4. In a film-perforating machine, the combination of a pin-drum, with means for intermittently rotating the same, a table, rails ad justably secured thereto, and a spring-influenced presser-foot pivoted to the rails, substantially as specified.  \n  Signed by me at New York city, (Manhattan,) New York, this 14th day of December,  \n , EBERHARD SCHNEIDER.

The shaft t carries a pulley Z) and fly-wheel 6 and is so coupled to the film-feeding mechanism that any wear of the shaft or its hearings will not injuriously affect the true feed movement of the film. To obtain this result, shaft 6 is provided with a disk 6 having a wrist-pin b. This pin engages a slot 0 of a disk 0 which is carried by a counter-shaft a, mounted in alinement with shaft 6. Counter-shaft c is journaled in adjustable eccentric bearings 0 rotatably fitted in circular openings of uprights a (1. Figs. 6 and 7. In order to adjust the bearings 0 and lock them in position, they are provided with flanges 0*, having curved slots o These slots are engaged by set-screws 0, tapped into uprights (1, (0. Upon counter-shaft e is mounted one member (Z of a Geneva movement, having pin d, which is adapted to engage the slots a of the second member a of said movement, which is mounted on spindle 0 By the means described the continuous rotation of shaft t is converted into an intermittent rotatory movement of spindle 0 while the engagement of the curved portions of the members (Z c positively locks spindle against movement between its periods of rotation. The adjustability of bearings 0 permits an accurate engagement to be effected between the members (Z a, thus avoiding any dead motion. Upon spindle e is mounted a pinion a, engaging a large gearwheel f. This wheel is provided with a curved slot f\", engaged by a set-screw g of a hub keyed at 7 to a spindle g. f of\"wheel f projects over the edge of hub Fig. 5, and holds the parts in axial aline ment' The spindle g is journaled in the uprights a (t and extends laterally beyond upright (4. Upon this extension is rigidly mounted a feed or pin drum )l/ for imparting the intermittent movement to the film A. This film is provided with a number of perforations by means of'the punches hereinafterdescribed, and these perforations are engaged by the pins 71/ of drum [1 such pins being arranged to conform to the position of the perforations. Thus it will be seen that by the means described the Geneva movement intermittently locks positively the spindle e and that the spindle in turn intermittently locks positively the pindrum it. Further, by means of the adjustable connection between gear-wheel fand hub an accurate adjustment between the Geneva movement and the pins of the pin-d rum 70 may be effected, so that the pins may be properly alined with the perforations in the film which have been previously produced by the punches. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The film passes from a suitable deliveryreel (not shown) over a table 2', against which The rim it is held by a presser-foot j, pivoted at y\" to side rails z\" of table 2'. These rails are laterally adjustable by means of a slot d in the rails engaged by setscrews i which are tapped into the table. A spring f holds the free end of presser-foot 1' down, and thereby prevents the film A from being raised off the table by the ascent of the punches B B. These punches pass through perforations f of presser-foot j, through the film, and into perforations k of a matrix In, countersunk into table 1', Fig. 4E. The severed particles of the film are ejected through chute Z. After clearing the punches B B the film, being now perforated, is engaged by the feed-drum it, such drum being journaled back of table iand and matrix k, Fig. 2. The film is held against the feed-drum by a roller m and is carried by the drum to a suitable receiving-reel. (Not shown.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The drawings illustrate two sets of punches B B, of which the punches B are adapted to make perforations A along the edges of the film or at the sides of the image-receiving spaces, while the punches B are adapted to make perforations A within the body of the film or between the image-receiving spaces. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is obvious, however, that either set of punches may be omitted and the machine be worked with but a single set. H eretofore it was usual to feed the film by the side perforations A only, which were either arranged in close proximity, as in Fig. 9, or farther apart, as in Fig. 19, one hole being formed in the latter case in alinement with the center of each image; but these side perforations are objectionable for a number of reasons, the principal ones being that they readily tear out and that they reduce the width of the film area available for the reception of the images. By forming the perforations A between each pair of adjoining images and at a distance from the edges of the film these objections are overcome, the life of the film is increased, and a wider panorama may be exhibited. Figs. 9 and 19 represent a film A, having side perforations A only. Figs. 10 to 12 show the side perforations A used in conjunction with different numbers of body-perforations A Fig. 11 illustrating the particular film made by the machine represented in the drawings. Figs. 15 to 15 represent films with body-perforations A only, while Figs. 16 to 18 repre sent films having spaced side perforations A in conjunction with diflerent numbers of bodyperforations A The means for operating the punches are as follows: Upon shaft?) is mounted an eccentric b engaged by a strap a. This strap is connected by a rod 91 to the lever 0 of a rock-shaft 0, journaled in .bearings a, so that each rotation of shaft I) will cause one complete oscillation of shaft 0. Shaft 0 has an arm 0 engaging a link 1), which is pivoted at 5 p to a cross-head g. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cross-head carries the plungers q of the punches B, such plungers being movable in tubular guides (1 The machine is so timed that the punches engage the film while the feed-drum b is at rest, when it is locked in position by the engagement of the curved sections of the Geneva movement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The punches B will descend once between each movement of the feed-drum, while the punches B should descend once-say after each fourth movement of such drum so as to clear the image-receiving spaces. This movement is imparted to the punches B in the following manner: Shaft Z) carries a pinion 6, meshing into a large gear-wheel r, having wrist-pin 1'. To this pin is connected one end of a rod 8, the other end of which is connected to the lever 25 of a tubular rockshaft 1., which is fitted loosely upon rockshaft 0. Shaft 25 has an arm t engaging a link u, which is pivoted at u to cross-head o. This cross-head carries the plungers o of punches B, the plungers being movable in tubular guides 41 The proportion of the wheels 5 r is shown to be such that the plungers n will descend once at each fourth rotation of shaft 6; but these proportions may manifestly be varied. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e If desired, the machine can be so constructed that different sets of punches may be operated by the same pair of plungers o. In this way the same machine may be used for forming all the various perforations illustrated in the drawings by attaching to the plungers o the particular set of punches desired. To obtain this result, the lower ends of the plungers o are mortised for the reception of pins 20, projecting from a plate 20, Fig. 8, which car ries the punch 102 or the set of punches de sired. The plate 20 is secured to the plungers o by set-screws 20 so that the plate may be readily removed and replaced by a plate carrying a different arrangement of punches. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The pins h of feed-drum h must correspond in position to the perforations made in the film by the punches. Thus if the punches B are used the pins it are set near the edges of drum it, Fig. 5, while when the punches B are used without punches B the pins h are set back, as shown in Fig. 5*. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is desirable that the drum 72. may be so turned that its pins h are brought into accurate engagement with the perforations A or A of film A. This adjustment is caused by slacking screw 9, changing the relative positions between hub g and wheel f, and then reclamping the hub to the wheel. In this way the position of drum It may be changed with relation to that of wheel f, and consequently to that of the driving-shaft. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e What I claim is 1. In a film-perforating machine, the combination of a driving-shaft with a first member of a Geneva movement actuated thereby, a second member of said movement engaging the first member, a pinion actuated by the second member, a gear-Wheel engaging the pinion, a hub adjustably secured to the gear- Wheel, a spindle carrying the hub, a pin-drum mounted on the spindle, and a punch, substantially as specified. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 2. in a film-perforating machine, the combination of a driving-shaft having a Wrist-pin, With a counter-shaft having aslotted disk engaged by said pin, a first member of a Geneva movement mounted on the counter-shaft, a second member of said movement engaging the first member, a pinion actuated by the second member, a gear-Wheel engaging the pinion, a hub adjustably secured to the gear- Wheel, a spindle carrying the hub, a pin-drum mounted on the spindle, and a punch, substantially as specified. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. In a film-perforating machine, the combination of a driving-shaft, With a countershaft coupled thereto, adjustable bearings for supporting the counter-shaft, a first member of a Geneva movement mounted on the counter-shaft, asecond member of said movement engaged by the first member, a pin-drum operatively connected to said second member, and a punch, substantially as specified. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 4. In a film-perforating machine, the combination of a pin-drum, with means for intermittently rotating the same, a table, rails ad justably secured thereto, and a spring-influenced presser-foot pivoted to the rails, substantially as specified. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Signed by me at New York city, (Manhattan,) New York, this 14th day of December, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, EBERHARD SCHNEIDER.

Serial No. 234,916.  \n 1\u0026#39;0 (ML LU/b07771 it may concern:  \n  Be it known that .l\u0026#39;, An\u0026#39;ru\u0026#39;oe J. ADAMS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Chicago, in the county of (look and State of Illinois, haveinvented a new and useful Improvement in Babylarriages, of which the following is a specification.  \n  My invention relates particularly to gocarts or folding baby-carriages adapted peculiarly for use in traveling, owing to their capability of being folded compactly.  \n  My primary object is to provide a carriage of the character indicated of exceedingly cheap and durable construction and better adapted to the comfort of the child than the :arriages for the same purpose heretofore known.  \n  My invention is illustrated in its preferred embodiment in the accompanying drawings, in which- Figure 1 representsa side elevational view of the improved carriage with the reclining back connected with the seat folded and occupying a position adapted to a sitting posture; Fig. 2, a plan view of the same; Fig. 3, a longitudinal sectional view taken as indicated at line 3 of Fig. 2; Fig. 4, a broken plan view taken as indicated at line 4 of Fig. and showing the running-gear, the seat and foot-rest being removed; Fig. 5, a view simi lar to Fig. 3, but shmving the back adapted :for a reclining position; Fig. 6, a plan section taken as indicated at line 6 of Fig. 3 and illustrating the connecting-rods employed for holding the wheel-supports or wheel-forks in an upright position; Fig. 7, a front view of the carriage with the seat, foot-rest, and attendant parts removed; Fig. 8, a section taken as indicated at line 8 of Fig. 1, showing a detail of a connection between metal and wood parts employed; Fig. 9, abroken section taken as indicated at line 9 of Fig. 5 and illustrating the manner in which the cross members of the running-gear frame are joined to the side members thereof; Fig. 10, a broken section taken as indicated at line 10 of Fig. 1 and showing a detail of a locking device employed, and Fig. 11 a section taken as indicated at line 11 of Fig. 10.  \n In the preferred embodiment of the inven tion illustrated, A represents a running-gear frame equipped with hinged wheel-supports A; B, a rearwardly-inclined handle connected with the rear end of the frame A; C, a fold ing seat-support provided with means for maintaining its rigidity in use, said seatsupport having col\u0026#39;mection at its front end with the front portion of the running-gear frame and at its rear end with the upper portion of the handle; D, a seat equipped with a back D, and D a foot-support, which preferably is supported upon the front portions of the side members of the runnii\u0026#39;ig-gear frame and has flexible connection with the front edge of the seat.  \n  The running-gear frame preferably comprises, Fig. 4:, substantially horizontal wooden side members (A, a forwardly-located tubular cross membc r a\u0026#39;,ha\\ \u0026#39;ing its ends joi nod to sheetmetal stampings a, which are connected by bolts (t with the side members a, foot-rest-supporting rods a, arranged on the inner sides of the front portions of the side members a, a rearwardly-loeated tubular cross member a, having its ends joined to sheet-metal stampings a, which are connected by bolts a with the rear. ends of the side members a, rods at, extending forwardly from the front ends of the stampings a to the cross member 11/ and affording means of connection between the runninggear frame and the side leathers of the seat, and forwardly and rearwardly located clips or sheet-metal stai\u0026#39;npings a\u0026#34; 4\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, respectively, affording pivot members through the medium of which the wheel-supports are joined to the running-gear frame. A detail of the connections between the cross member a and the stampings (b is shown in Fig. 9, from which it appears that each stamping is provided with an inwardly-struck hollow boss which receives the adjacent end of the tubular cross member, the parts being brazed together. Connections of the same character are employed for joining the tubular cross member a to the stampings a, and it may be here added that the front ends of the members a are bent inwardly to accommodate the rear pivot-clips or stampings a as shown in Fig. st.  \n The wheel-supports comprise short bars a\u0026#34;,  \n of relatively heavy material, equipped at their upper ends with sh eet-metal stampin gs afiording hinge members a, which are connected by pivots or \u0026#39;pintles a with the members a\u0026#34; (0 on the running-gear frame. The stampings a\u0026#34; lb comprise U-shaped members having their extremities bent over the top of the side members 1, as shown in Fig. 4, and having their lower web portions provided with downturned transverse pivot-lugs a, as shown in Fig. The stampings a are equipped with interned pivot-lugs a which are connected with the pivot-lugs a by the pins a. The members (1/ have upwardlyextending projections a, which engage the members a e and form stops, preventing the wheel-supports from swinging outwardly beyond the normal vertical position. The lower ends of the bars a are equipped with outwardly-projecting bolts (L17, upon whichthe wheels are journaled. The stampings a are placed on the inner sides of the rear portions of the side members a and have outwardlyturned flanges embracing the top and bottom edges of said members, as shown in Fig. 1. At their rear ends the members a have inclined projections a, as shown in Fig. 3,with which are connected hinge members a, attached to the lower ends of the side members of the handle and joined to the projections (1/ by pivots (0 The members a comprise stampings located at the inner sides of the lower ends of the side members of the handle and having outwardly-turned flanges embracing the edges of said side members, as shown in Fig. 1. The members a are provided with shoulders (0 which engage the rear ends of the lower flanges of the members a, as shown in Fig. 1, thereby serving to limit the rearward swing of the handle B.  \n  The upright bars a of the wheel-supports have their lower ends joined by longitudinal bars a, preferably comprising stampings. The ends of the bars (4 are offset inwardly at (4 the offset extremities being connected with the upright members a Adjacent\u0026#39;to the oflsets the bars are split longitudinally and have eyes 0/ struck inwardly. To the eyes of one bar a are pivotally connected transverse rods r17 whose free ends are equipped with downturned hooks or pins 0/ which engage the eyes a of the other bar cf. These hooks may be readily disengaged from the eyes to permit the rods (6 to be swung toward each other and folded alongside of the pivot-bar preparatory to folding the wheel-supports inwardly beneath the runninggear frame.  \n  The handle preferably comprises wooden side bars 5 and a cross-round Z), joining the upper ends thereof. The cross-round is connected with .the side members by screws 5 whose heads bear upon dished washers 5 having the form of the washer shown in Fig. 8. The members 5 of the handle are equipped l l l l fastening members comprising eyes 1), projecting inwardly from stems which extend through the side members 7) and are secured in place by n uts. The stems b extend through metal binding-clips 7) at the rear edges of the bars I).  \n  The seat-support C preferably comprises a pair of two-part folding side bars 0, having their upper ends connected by pivots 0 to the upper portions of the side members of the handle and their lower portions connected by pivots c with the front portions of the side members of the running-gear frame. Each side bar 0 comprises a front section 0 a rear section 0*, said sections being connected by a pivot 0 and a device 0 serving to automatically lock the members 0 0 together when the seat-support is in the extended or unflexed condition, as illustrated in the drawings. Each locking device comprises a housing or guide 0 connected with the member 0 asliding locking member 0 and a spring 0, confined between t he member 0 and the upper end of the housing. The housing is longitudinally slotted, as shown, to maintain the spring in its proper position. Each sliding locking member 0 comprises a U-shapedmemher having its flanges 0 turned inwardly and embracing the top and bottom edges of the member 0* and its web confined between the housing 0 and the member 0\u0026#34;. l/V hen the \u0026#34;locking member 0 is in its lowermost position, assuming the seat-support to be straight or unflexed, the flanges of the member 0 embrace the upper and lower edges of the upper extremity of the corresponding member 0 thereby serving to prevent flexing of the side member 0. The upper end of each member 0 extends some distance above the pivot 0 and has its end beveled, as shown at 0, the bevel serving to engage the lower flange of the slide and move the slide rearwardly against its spring during the operation of straightening the side member of the seat-support, the slide returning to the locking position after the side member has been straightened, so that automatic locking of the side member in its unflexed condition is effected. As best shown in Fig. 2, the sections 0 of the side members 0 have their end portions ofiset outwardly, so that when the side members are in the folded condition the sections 0* will occupy a position outside of and parallel with the sections 0, the locking devices not interfering with this result. Near the upper ends of the members of the sections 0 the metal is struck inwardly to form vertical eyes 0, which serve to receive the hooks of a removable back-supporting rod.  \n  The seat D may be of any suitable construction. Preferably it has a stiff bottom (Z and has its front edge linked by a pivoted stirrup (Z to the sections 0 of the side members 0 of the seat-support. This stirrup may comprise at some distance from their upper ends with l apiece of rod or heavy wire havingahorizontal middle portion and forwardly and upwardly inclined end portions (Z having outwardly turned extremities (7 extending through perforations in the sections 0 The portions (Z are sprung inwardly somewhat in putting the stirrup in place, so that the natural spring of the wire tends to maintain it in its proper position. The front edge of the seat is preferably joined by a flexible connection, usually leather, (i to the foot-support, and the foot-support is sustained by leather side pieces (Z joined to the rods (4*. The sides for the seat preferably comprise sections of leather or other flexible material (Z connected with the sections 0 of the seat-support and with the rods a of the running-gear frame. The back for the seat preferably comprises sections or parts d 7 (Z which may be folded upon each other, as shown in Fig. 3, or used in the extended position, as shown in Fig. 5. This back is provided with a loop (Z at the junction between the sections (Z (Z and a loop (Z at the free edge of the section (Z A cross rod d, having its extremities bent to form hooks or pins, may be inserted either in the loop d or in the loop (i and connected with the eyes 0 or the eyes 0, according as an upright or a reclining position for the back is desired. Side flaps (Z are connected with the lateral edges of the lower section cl of the back and are provided at their free edges with eyelets (Z adapted for connection with buttons, with which the rear vertical edges of the side leathers d are equipped. These flaps (Z are in use when the back is in its reclining position, and when the back in its substantially vertical position the flaps are folded back of the section (Z and the section (Z is allowed to drop down to cover the flaps. The section (Z is equipped with buttons (i which may be caused to engage the lowermost eyelets (Z of the flaps, thereby securely connecting the parts.  \n  In Fig. 8 is shown a detail of the preferred manner of joining the upper section a\u0026#34; of the side member of the seat-support to the corresponding side member of the handle. A bolt 0 extends through perforations in the side members 7) and the section 0*, and a washer f of special construction is interposed between the pivotally-connected members. The washer comprises a metal stamping having an inturned circumferential flange extending into a countersink in the wood, the bottom of the stamping projecting beyond the surrounding surface of the wood to afford a metal bearing for the section 0. This expedient is employed at other similar joints throughout the construction.  \n  The manner in which the carriage may be folded and unfolded will be understood without detailed des cription. Assuming the back to be arranged for a sitting posture and the carriage to be in proper condition for use, the locking members of may be grasped and retracted and the side members of the seat-support pressed down at their central joints, the handle being then free to be folded down upon the running-gear frame. Next, the crossrods o maybe unhooked and the wheel-supports folded inwardly and upwardly beneath the running-gear frame, thereby completing the folding of the carriage. In this condition the carriage is in exceedingly compact form and may be readily carried as hand-baggage. In unfolding the carriage to put itinto condition for use the reverse movements are employed.  \n  It will be observed that the manner of supporting the seat D is such as to prevent that rigidity which is so undesirable in this class of construction. Moreover, the seat is permitted a certain degree of movement which is conducive both to health and comfort. The feature of an extensible back capable of assuming a position corresponding with a sitting posture and a position corresponding with a reclining posture is a novelty in this class of construction and evidently adds greatly to the comfortableness of the carriage, since the child may be permitted to sleep as comfortably in this carriage as in the ordinary non-folding carriage.  \n  It will be appreciated that the feature of making the principal rigid parts of wood and metal stampings enables the cost of the cart to be red ueed to a minimum, while the durability is still very great. This is of very great importance, since, as a matter of fact, the ordinary folding carriage of the same general type is too expensive for general use.  \n  Many changes in details of construction within the spirit of my invention may be made. Hence no undue limitation should be understood from the foregoing detailed description, which has been given for clearness of understanding only.  \n  What I regard as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1.

A detail of the connections between the cross member a and the stampings (b is shown in Fig. 9, from which it appears that each stamping is provided with an inwardly-struck hollow boss which receives the adjacent end of the tubular cross member, the parts being brazed together. Connections of the same character are employed for joining the tubular cross member a to the stampings a, and it may be here added that the front ends of the members a are bent inwardly to accommodate the rear pivot-clips or stampings a as shown in Fig. st. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wheel-supports comprise short bars a\", \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof relatively heavy material, equipped at their upper ends with sh eet-metal stampin gs afiording hinge members a, which are connected by pivots or 'pintles a with the members a\" (0 on the running-gear frame. The stampings a\" lb comprise U-shaped members having their extremities bent over the top of the side members 1, as shown in Fig. 4, and having their lower web portions provided with downturned transverse pivot-lugs a, as shown in Fig. The stampings a are equipped with interned pivot-lugs a which are connected with the pivot-lugs a by the pins a. The members (1/ have upwardlyextending projections a, which engage the members a e and form stops, preventing the wheel-supports from swinging outwardly beyond the normal vertical position. The lower ends of the bars a are equipped with outwardly-projecting bolts (L17, upon whichthe wheels are journaled. The stampings a are placed on the inner sides of the rear portions of the side members a and have outwardlyturned flanges embracing the top and bottom edges of said members, as shown in Fig. 1. At their rear ends the members a have inclined projections a, as shown in Fig. 3,with which are connected hinge members a, attached to the lower ends of the side members of the handle and joined to the projections (1/ by pivots (0 The members a comprise stampings located at the inner sides of the lower ends of the side members of the handle and having outwardly-turned flanges embracing the edges of said side members, as shown in Fig. 1. The members a are provided with shoulders (0 which engage the rear ends of the lower flanges of the members a, as shown in Fig. 1, thereby serving to limit the rearward swing of the handle B. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The upright bars a of the wheel-supports have their lower ends joined by longitudinal bars a, preferably comprising stampings. The ends of the bars (4 are offset inwardly at (4 the offset extremities being connected with the upright members a Adjacent'to the oflsets the bars are split longitudinally and have eyes 0/ struck inwardly. To the eyes of one bar a are pivotally connected transverse rods r17 whose free ends are equipped with downturned hooks or pins 0/ which engage the eyes a of the other bar cf. These hooks may be readily disengaged from the eyes to permit the rods (6 to be swung toward each other and folded alongside of the pivot-bar preparatory to folding the wheel-supports inwardly beneath the runninggear frame. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The handle preferably comprises wooden side bars 5 and a cross-round Z), joining the upper ends thereof. The cross-round is connected with .the side members by screws 5 whose heads bear upon dished washers 5 having the form of the washer shown in Fig. 8. The members 5 of the handle are equipped l l l l fastening members comprising eyes 1), projecting inwardly from stems which extend through the side members 7) and are secured in place by n uts. The stems b extend through metal binding-clips 7) at the rear edges of the bars I). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The seat-support C preferably comprises a pair of two-part folding side bars 0, having their upper ends connected by pivots 0 to the upper portions of the side members of the handle and their lower portions connected by pivots c with the front portions of the side members of the running-gear frame. Each side bar 0 comprises a front section 0 a rear section 0*, said sections being connected by a pivot 0 and a device 0 serving to automatically lock the members 0 0 together when the seat-support is in the extended or unflexed condition, as illustrated in the drawings. Each locking device comprises a housing or guide 0 connected with the member 0 asliding locking member 0 and a spring 0, confined between t he member 0 and the upper end of the housing. The housing is longitudinally slotted, as shown, to maintain the spring in its proper position. Each sliding locking member 0 comprises a U-shapedmemher having its flanges 0 turned inwardly and embracing the top and bottom edges of the member 0* and its web confined between the housing 0 and the member 0\". l/V hen the \"locking member 0 is in its lowermost position, assuming the seat-support to be straight or unflexed, the flanges of the member 0 embrace the upper and lower edges of the upper extremity of the corresponding member 0 thereby serving to prevent flexing of the side member 0. The upper end of each member 0 extends some distance above the pivot 0 and has its end beveled, as shown at 0, the bevel serving to engage the lower flange of the slide and move the slide rearwardly against its spring during the operation of straightening the side member of the seat-support, the slide returning to the locking position after the side member has been straightened, so that automatic locking of the side member in its unflexed condition is effected. As best shown in Fig. 2, the sections 0 of the side members 0 have their end portions ofiset outwardly, so that when the side members are in the folded condition the sections 0* will occupy a position outside of and parallel with the sections 0, the locking devices not interfering with this result. Near the upper ends of the members of the sections 0 the metal is struck inwardly to form vertical eyes 0, which serve to receive the hooks of a removable back-supporting rod. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The seat D may be of any suitable construction. Preferably it has a stiff bottom (Z and has its front edge linked by a pivoted stirrup (Z to the sections 0 of the side members 0 of the seat-support. This stirrup may comprise at some distance from their upper ends with l apiece of rod or heavy wire havingahorizontal middle portion and forwardly and upwardly inclined end portions (Z having outwardly turned extremities (7 extending through perforations in the sections 0 The portions (Z are sprung inwardly somewhat in putting the stirrup in place, so that the natural spring of the wire tends to maintain it in its proper position. The front edge of the seat is preferably joined by a flexible connection, usually leather, (i to the foot-support, and the foot-support is sustained by leather side pieces (Z joined to the rods (4*. The sides for the seat preferably comprise sections of leather or other flexible material (Z connected with the sections 0 of the seat-support and with the rods a of the running-gear frame. The back for the seat preferably comprises sections or parts d 7 (Z which may be folded upon each other, as shown in Fig. 3, or used in the extended position, as shown in Fig. 5. This back is provided with a loop (Z at the junction between the sections (Z (Z and a loop (Z at the free edge of the section (Z A cross rod d, having its extremities bent to form hooks or pins, may be inserted either in the loop d or in the loop (i and connected with the eyes 0 or the eyes 0, according as an upright or a reclining position for the back is desired. Side flaps (Z are connected with the lateral edges of the lower section cl of the back and are provided at their free edges with eyelets (Z adapted for connection with buttons, with which the rear vertical edges of the side leathers d are equipped. These flaps (Z are in use when the back is in its reclining position, and when the back in its substantially vertical position the flaps are folded back of the section (Z and the section (Z is allowed to drop down to cover the flaps. The section (Z is equipped with buttons (i which may be caused to engage the lowermost eyelets (Z of the flaps, thereby securely connecting the parts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In Fig. 8 is shown a detail of the preferred manner of joining the upper section a\" of the side member of the seat-support to the corresponding side member of the handle. A bolt 0 extends through perforations in the side members 7) and the section 0*, and a washer f of special construction is interposed between the pivotally-connected members. The washer comprises a metal stamping having an inturned circumferential flange extending into a countersink in the wood, the bottom of the stamping projecting beyond the surrounding surface of the wood to afford a metal bearing for the section 0. This expedient is employed at other similar joints throughout the construction. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The manner in which the carriage may be folded and unfolded will be understood without detailed des cription. Assuming the back to be arranged for a sitting posture and the carriage to be in proper condition for use, the locking members of may be grasped and retracted and the side members of the seat-support pressed down at their central joints, the handle being then free to be folded down upon the running-gear frame. Next, the crossrods o maybe unhooked and the wheel-supports folded inwardly and upwardly beneath the running-gear frame, thereby completing the folding of the carriage. In this condition the carriage is in exceedingly compact form and may be readily carried as hand-baggage. In unfolding the carriage to put itinto condition for use the reverse movements are employed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be observed that the manner of supporting the seat D is such as to prevent that rigidity which is so undesirable in this class of construction. Moreover, the seat is permitted a certain degree of movement which is conducive both to health and comfort. The feature of an extensible back capable of assuming a position corresponding with a sitting posture and a position corresponding with a reclining posture is a novelty in this class of construction and evidently adds greatly to the comfortableness of the carriage, since the child may be permitted to sleep as comfortably in this carriage as in the ordinary non-folding carriage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be appreciated that the feature of making the principal rigid parts of wood and metal stampings enables the cost of the cart to be red ueed to a minimum, while the durability is still very great. This is of very great importance, since, as a matter of fact, the ordinary folding carriage of the same general type is too expensive for general use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Many changes in details of construction within the spirit of my invention may be made. Hence no undue limitation should be understood from the foregoing detailed description, which has been given for clearness of understanding only. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e What I regard as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

Serial No. 181,616.  \n To ({JZ Ir/7mm, it may concern-r Be it known that I, Momaon Gulrrr, a citizen of the United States of America, residing at Hartford, in the county of Hartford and State of Connecticut, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Electric Switches, of which the following is a specili- :ation.  \n  This invention has for its object the im- IO provement of electric switches whereby they may be operated by lever mechanism in place of the customary turn-buttons or push-buttons.  \n  The invention is particularly adapted for use in pendent switches, and it is such an em bodiment of the invention that is illustrated in the drawings.  \n  Figure 1 is a front view of the device removed from the casing. Fig. 2 is a side view. Fig. 3 is a plan view of the operating-levers in their extended or normal position, show ing in dotted line the operating-arm. Fig. at is a view of the operating-levers, showing their position at the time when the arm is 2 5 about to be released. Fig. 5 is a view of the operating parts after the switch has been thrown and before the levers are released.  \n Fig.6 is a perspective view from underneath the arm 5. Fig. 7 is a general outside view of the device. Fig. 8 illustrates the springdetent plate in plan and edge view. Fig. 9 is a detail view showing the oscillating member and its connection with the movable contact.  \n  Referring to the drawings, ((1 is a spindle mounted on a base of insulating material. On this base are also secured the contacts a a.  \n  Z) is a switch-plate rotatably mounted on the spindle (I! and having a blade cooperating with the contacts a\u0026#34; a. The switch-plate is engaged on its under side by spring-detents a. which permit of its rotation in one direction only. Secured to the outer side of the 4 5 switch-plate are stops 0.  \n (Z is an oscillating member mounted on the spindle (t. On its under side are spring-detents 0\u0026#39;, which engage the stops on the switchplate. so that it will move with the oscillating member (I.  \n  The spring-detent s underneath the switchplate permits its forward movement with the oscillating member \u0026#39;(7. During the return movement of the oscillating member (I while the detent r is moving over the outer face of the switch-plate the detent x engages the under side of the s\\vitcl\u0026#39;1-1.)late and prevents its backward movement. It will thus be seen that when the oscillating member moves forward it carries with it the switch-plate Z) and when the oscillating member returns to its original position the switch plate is held against backward movement by the springdetent a.  \n  On. the posts g It are pivoted the levers f, which control the mechanism which aetuates the oscillating member (I. These levers are connected by the gear-teeth a\u0026#39;f, so that their movements with respect to one another will be properly timed in order that the cooperating parts on the two levers shall work together properly. The lever c is projected beyond the post 7 and has the upstanding ledge n. An arm 1\u0026#39;. is pivoted to the top of the post it. Both the arm 1 and the lever f are provided with upstanding projections v\u0026#34; 7 which normally are rad y in line as 5 seen in Figs. 1 and 3. About the post /t there is coiled a spring in, whose ends lie on opposite sides of these projections f\u0026#34;, as clearly seen in Figs. 1 and 3.  \n  The arm 1\u0026#39; has the downwardly-projecting finger 7), which co perates with the upstanding ledge n, as will be hereinafter described. The end of the arm \u0026#39;1: is connected with the oscillating member through the linltj. This arm is also provided with a pawl projection 7\u0026#34;, which is adapted to cooperate-with the stop 0 on the switch-plate?) to determine the amount of movement at each throw of the switchplate.  \n  A spring q, surrounding the post g and hav ing its ends confined between a pin on the lever e and a stationary post, is provided to return the parts to their normal position.  \n The switch above described operates as follows: Fig. 1 shows the normal position of the parts, the levers cf being extended and the springs in relaxed. As the levers 0,7\u0026#34; are broughttogether,as by pressure with the hand, as shown in Fig. I, the inner surface of the upstanding ledge 72 rides around the linger p on the arm 1, thus holding the arm \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; against movement. This causes the spring m to be compressed, as shown in Fig. 4. Further movement of the levers e f causes the ledge a to ride by the linger p, and so release the arm 2\u0026#39;, at which time the spring 112, tending to return to its relaxed condition, throws the arm a over to the position shown in Fig. 5, bringing it into its normal relation with the arm f. The oscillating member (Z is connected with the arm 1\u0026#39; through the link 7\u0026#39; and is thrown forward by this movement of the arm 2\u0026#39;, carrying with it the switch-plate to the position shown in Fig. 5. The pawl projection it on the arm 2\u0026#39; is carried into the path of movement of the stops 0 on the switch-plate and is engaged thereby to determine the amount of movement of the switch-plate at each throw. As is clearly shown in Fig. 1, the act of bringing the levers e 7\u0026#34; together compresses the spring 9, so that when the levers are relieved from pressure these springs return the parts to their normal position, as shown in Fig. 1.  \n  This type ofswitch and the manner in which it is operated is particularly adaptable for pendent switches, which are in very general use, and it is such an embodiment of the invention that is shown in the drawings, Fig. 7 showing the appearance of the switch when in use, the parts being inclosed in a suitable casing i. As is evident, the details of construction are susceptible of modification and alteration without departing from the scope of the invention.  \n I claim as my invention- 1.

MERRY,  \n v a citizen of the United States, residing at Kanpart of the mounting known as the nose-\u0026#39; guard.  \n  It is the object of my invention to provide a mounting in which the nose-guard 18 so constructed as to be practically unnoticeable while the eyeglasses are being worn andto accomplish this object without sacrificing the gripping strength or elasticity of the guard. In doing this I provide improved details of structure, which will presently be fully described, and pointed out in the claim, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, in which like reference-numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views, and in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a mounting provided with my improved guard.v Fig. 2 is a front elevation of a pair of eyeglasses provided with such a mounting as they ap pear when posited on the nose of the wearer. Fig. 3 is a detail perspective view of the noseguard.  \n  Referring more in detail to the drawings, 1 is the usual post or stud to which the parts carrying the lenses are secured. 2 is the ordinary nose-spring, usually secured to the inner end of stud 1 by means of a screw passing through said spring and into said stud.  \n  Secured to stud 1, preferably by means of the screw which holds spring 2, is the lip 3 of a depending nose-guard 4, which is preferably constructed of but a single piece of metal.  \n Lip 3 extends at an angle to the body of the guard in order that it may fit smoothly on stud 1. Below lip 3 guard 4; is provided with an offset 5 for a purpose presently to be described, and at the lower end of said guard is a spring-loop 6. After making loop 6 guard 4 extends upwardly to form a gripping member 7 which is provided at its upper end with a suitable button or enlarged portion 8. In order to make the nose-guard as inconspicuous as possible, loop 6 is made very small, which necessarily decreases the elasticity of the guard, tending to render the same stiff and unyielding. \u0026#39;Io obviate this, I provide gripping member 7 with longitudinal cut-out portions or grooves 9, thereby providing the requisite springiness or gradual flexibility for a safe and comfortable guard. In the use of a mounting provided with such a guard when the eyeglasses are placed in position on the bridge of the nose the button or enlarged portion on the upper end of the gripping memher will rest against the base of the nose and will be sprung back slightly over ofiset 5, which itself will yield slightly,while the lower part of the gripping member will have a yielding pressure against a lower portion of the nose, this arrangement throwing the upper part of the gripping member directly behind the stud and the lower parts of the guard very close together, which gives the mounting a neat and compact appearance not ordinarily obtained.  \n  I have not described in detail the parts of the mounting not included in my invention, as these maybe of any suitable pattern or construction, and I do not wish to limit myself to the use of any particular kind. Neither do I wish to be understood as limiting myself to the exact details of construction herein shown and described, as the same may be varied without departing from the spirit of my invention.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new therein, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  In a mounting for eyeglasses, the combination with a nose spring and lens carrying parts, of a one-piece nose-guard having a lip on its inner end for securing same to said nose-\u0026#39; portion is pressed thereagainst, substantially IO spring and lens-carrying parts, a rearwardlyas and forthe purpose set forth.  \n extending oflsetbelow said lip, a doWnWardly- In testimony whereof I aflix my signature in extendilng portion, below slaid oiffset, having a presence of two Witnesses.  \n  springoop at its lower en an an upwardly- 1 extending portion above said loop having lon- FRILD\u0026#39; MERE) \u0026#39;gitudinal grooves along its face, the upper Witnesses: part of said upwardly-extending portion be- S.

Serial No. 142,034.  \n To all whom it may\u0026#39;conccrn:  \n  Be it known that I, FREDERICK F..RooHn, of Lincoln, in the county of Providence and State of Rhode Island, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Looms for Leno-Weaving; and I do hereby declare the following specification, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, forming a part of the same, to be afull, clear, and exact description thereof.  \n  The present invention relates to looms for weaving leno or gauze fabrics, and has for its object to provide a simple and eflicient\u0026#39;rnechanism for producing fabrics \u0026#34;of this character.  \n  To that end the invention consists inthe com-. bination, with the usual parts of an ordinary loom, ofacombined comb and reed, with mechanism for giving to such combined comb and reed both vertical and lateral movements, whereby both the opening of the shed and the crossing of the threads will be effected by said combined-comb and reed and without the employment of any harness or other additional devices.  \n  Referring to the drawings, Figure l is a front elevation, partly in section, of a portion of a loom with my invention applied thereto. Fig. 2 is a vertical section of the same, and Fig. 3 a detaih A represents the frame of the loom, in which is mounted the main shaft B, provided with fast and loose pulleys a a. The shaft B is provided with the usualcranks b b for operat: ing the lay C through the connecting-links c.  \n  D is the combined comb and reed, which is provided with alternate long dents (Z and short dents d. The-long dents 0Z extend the full width of the reed and are secured at each end to the frame. The short dents 01 extend about one-half the widthof the reed and are secured 1 These to the frame only at their lower ends.  \n cam-shaft E is provided with two cams c c for giving to the combined comb and reed its vertical or up-and-down movements and with a third cam e for giving to the combined comb and reed its lateral or to-and-fro movements. Two treadles or levers ff are pivoted to the frame and arranged to beactuated by the cams e 6\u0026#39;, respectively. In practice the treadles or levers ff are usually arranged to underlie the cams c 6, respectively; but for convenience in the drawings each of the treadles is shown as providedv with an offset or projection carrying the roller f to be acted upon by the cam. As the cam-shaft E makes only one revolution for every two revolutions of the shaft B, each of the cams e c has two cam projections, the cam a being provided with the camprojections e e and the cam a being provided with the cam projections e a. One of\u0026#39;the treadles, f, is connected. by means of the cord g,-jack 7t, and cords i, with the lower side of the combined comb and reed, and the other treadle, f, is connected, by means of the cord 9, jack 7t; and cords 11, with the upper side of the combined comb and reed, the cords a\u0026#34; passing over suitable pulleys 2\u0026#39; 2\u0026#39; on the frame. The arrangement of these parts is such that when one of the treadles is depressed by its cam the combined comb and reed will be raised, and when the other treadle is depressed by its cam the combined comb and reed will be lowered.  \n  Pivoted to the frameA\u0026#39;is a lever j, which is arranged to overlie the cam e and is provided with a pin or projection which enters a cam-groove e formed in said cam. Secured to the combined comb and reed and depending therefrom is\u0026#39;an arm lawhich is forked at its lower end, so as to embrace the free end of thelever j, so that the movement of said lever willbe impartedto-the combined comb and reed. As the cam-shaft E revolves the lever j is moved backand forth by the cam 0 thereby giving to the combined comb and reed its lateral or to -and-fro movement. The slot in the forked end of the arm Z0 permits the proper vertical movements of the combined comb and reed, while maintaining 25 across the threads Z.  \n 45 or other similar devices.  \n an operative connection between the lever and arm.  \n  As shown in the drawings, the warp-threads Z Z are led from the warp roll m over the 5 Whip-roll a and pass directly from the whiproll to the combined comb and reed and thence pass directly through the reed of the lay to the fabric. One set of the war p-threads, as Z, are passed through the eyes (Z of the short dents of the combined comb and reed,  \n and the other set of warp-threads, as Z, are passed between the long dents and the short dents, as shown.  \n The operation is as follows: At the first pick the combined comb and reed is raised to open the shed, as shown in Fig. 2. After the shuttle has crossed to lay the weft-thread the combined comb and reed is depressed, and when the upper ends of the short dents have been brought below the warp-threads Z will be crossed back of the weft-thread, thereby producing the leno or gauze weave. After the next weft-thread has been laid the combined comb and reed is again depressed, then moved laterally in the opposite direction to effect another crossing of the threads Z and Z,  \n and then raised to open the shed for the next pick, and so on. It will be seen that the opening of the shed for the next pick, as well as the crossing of the threads, is performed 4 solely by the combined comb and reed and that no harness or other devices are required for the purpose, the cross-Weaving being ontirely performed by the combined comb and reed Without the cooperation of any harness It will also be noted that as no harness is employed or required the shed opens clear back to the whip-roll and that by reason of this long shed no easerroll is required.  \n  What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent. is  \n  1. In a loom, the combination, with the operating mechanism, of a combined comb and reed comprising long dents and short dents, the short dents being provided with eyes to receive one set of the warp-threzuls, and means forgiving to said combined comb and reed both a vertical and a lateral movement at each pick, substantially as described.  \n 2. In a loom, the combination, with the operating mechanism, of a combined comb aml reed connin\u0026#39;ising long dents and short dents, the short dents being provided with eyes to receive one set of the war \u0026#39;i-thrcads, and means for giving to said combined comb and reed a lateral movement to cross the warp-thremls, and then an upward movement to open the shed for the next pick and so on successively at each pick, substantially as described.  \n  3. In a loom, the combination, with the opcratingmechanism, of a whip-roll, a combined comb and reed comprising long dents and short dents, the short dents being provided with eyes to receive one set of the warpthreads, said warp-threads being led directly from the whip-roll to the eyes in said dents, and means for giving to said combined comb and reed both vertical and lateral movements at each pick, substantially as described.  \n  4. In a loom, the combination, with the cam-shaft provided with cams, of a combined comb and reed comprising long dents and short dents, the short dents being provided with eyes to receive one set of the warpthreads, and connections between said camshaft and combined comb and reed forgiving to said combined comb and reed both vertical and lateral movements at each pick, substantially as described.  \n FREDERICK F.

The slot in the forked end of the arm Z0 permits the proper vertical movements of the combined comb and reed, while maintaining 25 across the threads Z. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45 or other similar devices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean operative connection between the lever and arm. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e As shown in the drawings, the warp-threads Z Z are led from the warp roll m over the 5 Whip-roll a and pass directly from the whiproll to the combined comb and reed and thence pass directly through the reed of the lay to the fabric. One set of the war p-threads, as Z, are passed through the eyes (Z of the short dents of the combined comb and reed, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the other set of warp-threads, as Z, are passed between the long dents and the short dents, as shown. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operation is as follows: At the first pick the combined comb and reed is raised to open the shed, as shown in Fig. 2. After the shuttle has crossed to lay the weft-thread the combined comb and reed is depressed, and when the upper ends of the short dents have been brought below the warp-threads Z will be crossed back of the weft-thread, thereby producing the leno or gauze weave. After the next weft-thread has been laid the combined comb and reed is again depressed, then moved laterally in the opposite direction to effect another crossing of the threads Z and Z, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then raised to open the shed for the next pick, and so on. It will be seen that the opening of the shed for the next pick, as well as the crossing of the threads, is performed 4 solely by the combined comb and reed and that no harness or other devices are required for the purpose, the cross-Weaving being ontirely performed by the combined comb and reed Without the cooperation of any harness It will also be noted that as no harness is employed or required the shed opens clear back to the whip-roll and that by reason of this long shed no easerroll is required. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent. is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

Figs. 5  \n and 6 are details in section on the lines ,5 5and I 6 6 of Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.  \n  Referring specifically to the drawings, 6 indicates the frame or bolster of the vehicle, to the ends of which are secured in suitable form the outriders or supporting-arms 7. The upper spring, which I will designate the carrier-spring, is indicated at\u0026#39;8 and the lower or load spring at 9, these springs being of the leaf kind and fastened together at the middle by clips in an ordinary manner. These springs are connected at both ends to the outriders. The tension of the spring 8 is such that it supports, when in the position shown in full lines in the drawings, the normal weight of the vehicle-body-that is, such spring if released would rise to the position, say, indicated by the dotted lines 8 in the drawings, but when connected the weight of the vehicle body causes it to take the position shown in full lines. is that shown in full linesthat is, in the position shown in the drawings it supports no weight, the weight of the vehicle, as stated above, being entirely sustained by the spring The normal position of the spring 9 wa A , J j 8. If, however, the vehicle be loaded, the weight of the load is taken by the spring 9, or, in other words, the combined weight of the vehicle and the load is taken by the two springs. The tension or curvature of the springs 8 and 9 is determined in advance, according to the weight of the vehicle-body, so that when the springs are applied said weight will cause the spring 8 to bend to the extent required for the attachment of the outriders 7 to both springs. This attachment may be effected in various ways, as shown in the drawings.  \n  In Fig. 1 the springs are curled at the ends to form eyes, the upper spring being curled up and the lower spring being curled down, and the outriders are connected by links 11 and 12 and pins 13, 14, and 15, extending through the links and the eyes of the\u0026#39;outriders and springs. Double links are used, as clearly shown in the sectional view Fig. 5. In the form shown in Fig. 2 the ends of the leaves are left plain or flat and are slotted, as at 16. Single links are used, (indicated, respectively, at 11 and 12.) These links we tend through the slots, and each link is provided with rollers 17, which bear on top of the respective springs. These rollers are carried by the pins 13 and 14, and the latter also serves to connect the outrider with the links, the eye of the outrider being forked, as indicated at 7*, Fig. 6, to take the link therebetween, the links being halved and lapped where the pin passes through between the forks of the outrider, as clearly shown in Fig. 6. This construction is decidedly advantageous and allows a free and easy movement, since the rollers will travel on the springs to the required extent during the various movements. A stop-pin is inserted in the lower end of the link 12 to hold the same in place,  \n spring is shown, as indicated at 9, but with a different arrangement of rigid links, as indicated at 11\u0026#34;, each link being connected by pins 13 and 15 to the eyes at the ends of the respective springs, and the outrider is connected direct by the pin 15\u0026#34;, there being an absence of the knuckle-jointed links (shown in Figs. 1 and 2) heretofore described.  \n  The double springs above described result in a very easy-riding vehicle whether it be empty or loaded.  \n  VVhatl claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. The combination of two half-leaf springsections secured together at the middle and flexibly connected by links at the ends, one section being of proper tension to substantially equal and support the normal unloaded weight, and the other of which is active only under load, and arms connected to the links and adapted for attachment to a vehicle-bod y.  \n  2. The combination with two leaf-spring sections secured together at the middle and having slotted ends, of links extending through the slots and provided with rollers bearing upon each section, and attachingarms connected to the links.  \n  In testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \n MICHAEL M.

Serial No. 241,654.  \n To (Jl/ZZ whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, JAMES HARDING BROWN, a citizen of the United States, residing at Eau Claire, in the county of Eau Claire and State of Wisconsin, have invented a new and useful Saw-Swage, of which the followingis a specification.  \n This invention relates to band-saw swages.  \n  rlhe object of the invention is to provide a swage in which the operator may inspect the teeth being swaged, thereby to secure accurate swaging of all the teeth and also to obviate mashing, which frequently occurs where merely the judgment of the operator as to the degree of force or pressure to be applied is relied upon to determine when the tooth is properly swaged; furthermore, to improve the manner of combining\u0026#39; the anvil and swage with the implement, so that these parts may readily be removed from the stock or body portion of the implement without interfering with any of the parts of the latter.  \n  With the above and other objects in view, as will appear as the nature of the invention is better understood, the same consists in the novel construction and combination of parts of a band-saw swage, as will be hereinafter fully described and claimed.  \n In the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this specification, and in which like characters of reference indicate correspond ing parts, Figure l is a View in perspective exhibiting a portion of a band-saw with the implement of the present invention combined therewith. Fig. 2 is avertical transverse sectional view taken on the line 2 2, Fig. 1, and looking in the direction of the arrow. Fig. 3 is a view in vertical longitudinal section taken on the line 3 3, Fig. 2. Fig. 4 is a perspective detail view of the headblock viewed from its rear.  \n - Referring to-the drawings, l designates the stock of the implement, which is provided, as usual, with a pair of saw-clamping screws 2 and 3, with a saw-slot 4, and witha gage, (designated generally 5.) The clamping-screw 2 carries a nut 6, by which it is locked at any desired adjustment, and the screw 3 carries a lever 7, as usual, by which to effect positive clamping of the saw S in position.  \n  The gage comprises acurvcd arm 8, which is secured at one end to the stock by bolts 9 and is provided at its other end with an adjusting-bolt 10, adapted to clamp the slotted arm 11 of a saddle 12 in any desired adjustment, the saddle having combined with it a plate 13 to shield its crest against wear by contact with the saw-teeth. These parts may be of the usual or any preferred construction and may he otherwise shaped and assembled without departing from the spirit of the invention.  \n  The gist of the presentinvention residesin the novel manner of combining the anvil and the swage-die with the stock in such manner as to permit of their being removed without interfering with the other parts of the implement. To secure this result, there is a headblock 14 provided, which is secured to the \u0026#39;face of the stock by bolts 15. This headblock is bifureated for a portion of its length at 16 to permit positioning\u0026#39; of the saw-teeth relatively to the anvil and the swage-die, and the upper portion of the bifurcation is enlarged at17 to present a sight-opening,th rough which the swage-die 18 and anvil 19 may be inspected, the latter being of the usual construction-that is, consisting\u0026#39; of a shaft having an intermediate eccentric portion 20 coacting with the anvil 19 in swaging saw-teeth. It will be observed by reference to Fig. 1 that the outer face of the stock, or that to which the head-block is secured, is obliquely disposed relatively to its length, and by this arrangement the inspection of the work through the sight-opening17 is facilitated and a better view is obtained than could result if the head-block were arranged at right angles to the length of the stock. The swagedie carries a. lever 21, by which it is rotated and is held against lateral movementrelatively to the head-block by a yoke or keeper 22, which engages a groove- 23, formed in the die for this purpose. The anvil, as clearly shown in Figs. 3 and 4, is constructed of an approximately rectangular block of metal having its lower face 22 beveled at an incline to its length and pitched at the proper angle to coact with the central portion of the swage-die to effect proper upsetting of the saw-teeth.  \n  To secure proper adjustment of the anvil relatively to the swage-die, a jam or adjusting bolt 23 is provided, which is carried by the upper portion of the head-block, as clearly shown in Fig. 3.  \n  It will be seen from the foregoing description that inasmuch as the saw-swage portion proper of the implement is carried entirely by ahead-block that in the event of breakage of either of these parts repairs may quickly and cheaply be effected, as it will only necessitate loosening of the bolts 15 to render it possible to remove the anvil and replace a new one to remove the swage-die. The latter, however, may be detached without removing the headblock by loosening the yoke 22.  \n  With the saw-swage of ordinary construction damage to that portion carrying the swage-die and anvil will render the whole implernent inoperative, whereas with the present invention damage to these parts would\u0026#39;only necessitate the renewal of the head-block, if this be injured, and of the swage-die and anvil.  \n  Having thus described the invention, what is claimed isl. In a saw-swage, the combination with a stoclnof a head-block detachably connected to the forward portion thereof and provided Y with a longitudinal channel a portion of which is enlarged to present a siglit-oliiening, a swage-die carried by the head-blocl and having its operative portion disposed opposite the sight-opening, an anvil mounted within the channel and having its operative point disposed opposite the sight-opening, and means for adjusting the an vil relatively to the swagedie. f  \n  2. In a saw-swage, the combination with a stock having its outer end disposed obliquely to its length, of a head-block detachably connected with the oblique portion and provided with a longitudinal channel a portion of which is enlarged to present a sight f opening, a swage-die carried by the head-block and having its operative face disposed opposite the sight-opening, an anvil mounted within the channel and having its operative point disposed opposite the sight-opening, and means for adjusting the anvil relatively to the swagedie.  \n  In testimony that I claim the foregoing as my own I have hereto aixed my signatu re in the presence of two witnesses.  \n JAMES HARDING BROWN.  \n Witnesses:  \n W.

Serial No. 250,743.  \n T0 at whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, NAPOLEON Borvnnr, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Lawrence, county of Essex, State of Massachusetts, have invented an Improvement in WVarp Stop-Motions for Looms, of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specification, like characters on the drawings representing like parts.  \n  This invention has for its object the production of simple mechanism for indicating,automatically to the weaver whether a released detector is in the front or rear bank of detectors in a single-thread warp stop-motion mechanism, means being provided whereby by\u0026#39;a simple and rapidly -executed manual operation the position of the released detector in its particular bank is readily found.  \n My invention is particularly adapted for use p in connection with warp stop-motion mechanism wherein the stop-m\u0026#39;otion-controlling detectors are arranged in two parallel banks, each detector being governed by a single warpthread. Several hundred detectors are usually contained in each bank, and when the 7 bank in which the released detector is located has been indicatedautomatically in the present instance-its position among its fellows must be discovered. By means of my present invention this is readily found by manual operation of the automatic indicating means, as will be fully described hereinafter.  \n  Figure 1 is a transverse section of a loom having a warp stop-motion mechanism of the type referred to and with my present invention applied thereto. Fig. 2 is an enlarged detail in front elevation of one end of the controlling-detectors, showing more clearly the novel features of my invention; and Fig. 3 is a crosssection on the line 3 3, Fig. 2, looking toward the left, the signal being set to show that the released detector is in the rear bank.  \n  In the drawings, Fig. 1, the stop-motioncontrolling detectors d5 d arranged in parallel banks and slotted longitudinally to receive the transverse supports 6?, attached at their ends to brackets, as B, bolted to stands a on the loom sides, the back-stops B and B the separator B between the detectors and also serving as a warp-rest, each detector be- 1ng governed by a single warp-thread, and the feeler f, rigidly connected by arms f with a rock -shaft F, located below the detectors, may be and are all substantially of well-known construction.  \n  The means for effecting the normal vibration of the feeler and for effecting the release of the shipper S form no part of my present invention; but they may be conveniently such as shown in United States Patent to Stimpson, No. 673,824., dated May 7 1901. Of such means I have shown only the upper ends of the links h and if, the former pivotally connected with-an arm f loosely mounted on the rock-shaft F and normally turning the same by or through the spring 8, Fig. 2, as in said patent, the link if being pivotally connected with an arm f fixedly secured to the rock-shaft. An upright stand 1 is secured to the back-stop B, (see particularly Fig. 2,) adjacent the bracket B and at the front of the two banks of detectors, stand being overturned to form an overhanging projection 2, Figs. 2 and 3. Below this projection an index 3, shown as a transverse rise or lug on the outer face of the stand 1, is arranged to cooperate with a signal, the position of the signal with relation to such index indicating in which bank the released detector is located. Below the index the upright is provided with an apertured horizontal ear 4, through which is loosely extended an upright vertically-movable rod 5, pivotally connected at its lower end to an arm 6, fast on the feeler rock-shaft F. The upper end of the rod 5 is bent over and forward, as at 7, to form a visual indicator or signal as well as a finger-piece.  \n  When the feeler is arrested by a released detector in the rear bank, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, the arm 6 is depressed, and thereby the signal 7 is positioned substantially directly in .front of the index 3, the weaver knowing that when the signal is so positioned the released detector must be looked for in the rear bank. If, on the other hand, the released detector is in the front bank, the arm 6 will be held up in its dotted-line position, Fig.  \n 3, so that the signal 7 will assume its dotted-.  \n the finger-piece 7 and press upward, thereby causing the feeler to grip the detector 03 and when the fingers are drawn across the detectors of the rear bank the free ones will sway or move more or less, while the gripped de- \u0026#39;tector will be held rigid,-and this will instantly be noted by the weaver. Thus manual operation of the automatic means serves to readily find the released detector in its particular bank. If the released detector is in the front bank, of course the weaver will press down on the finger-piece 7 to hold such detector while the fingers are passed across the detectors in the front bank.  \n  Having fully described my invention, What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. In a loom, in combination, two banks of stop-motion-controlling detectors each governed by a single warp-thread,- a vibrating feeler to engage and be arrested by a released detector in either bank, and automatically-acting means to indicate in which bank the released detector is located, said means including a vertically-reciprocating signal and a fixed index adjacent thereto, and a connection between the signal and the feeler, to reciprocate vertically the signal and vary its position with relation to the index.  \n - 2.

De Vrro, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Boston, in the county of Suffolk and State of hlassachusetts, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Liquid-Supply Apparatus for ashboards, of which the following is a specilication.  \n  This invention relates to improvements in liquid-supply apparatus for washboards; and it has for its object the washing of clothes with hot or cold water with or without liquid soap or soapy water supplied to the washboard, as will be hereinafter more fully shown and described, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is afront elevation of the apparatus, showing the set washtub in section. Fig. 2 is a partial top plan view of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a vertical section on the line 3 3 shown in Fig. 1. Fig. A is an enlarged section on the line 4 c shown in Fig. l, and Fig. 5 is an enlarged cross-section on the line 5 5 shown in Fig.  \n  Similar letters refer to similar parts wherever they occur on the diiferent parts of the drawings.  \n  In the drawings, A represents a set washtub secured to the wall B, as usual. To one end of the set tub is detachably secured a suitable bracket O, preferably hooked over the end of the tub, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Upon said bracket is detachably supported a tank D, divided, by means of a diaphragm (Z, into an upper compartment D and a lower compartment D. The upper compartment D contains a soapy solution E, and the lower compartment D contains hot or cold water E\u0026#34;, as shown in Fig. 4:.  \n  (Z is a removable cover on top of the tank D, which maybe removed when filling the compartment l)\u0026#34; with the soapy solution.  \n  Above the diaphragm (Z is arranged within the compartment 1) a delivery-pipe F, provided with exitsff, coinciding with a perforation (1 in the diaphragm (Z, as shown, for the purpose of discharging part of the contents of the soapy solution E into the water E\u0026#34;, as shown in Fig. i. \\Vithin the pipe F is arranged a slide-valve F, which when drawn out, as shown in Fig. 4, allows the soapy solution E to pass out through the perforations f f and d into the lower water compartment D for mixing it with the Wa\u0026#39; ter E contained in the lower compartment, as shown in Fig. 4. When it is desired to close the supply from the upper to the lower compartment, the valve-stem F is pushed in, so as to close the orifices connecting the upper and lower compartments.  \n  \\Vithin the upper part of the lower compartment is located a water-supply pipe Gr, provided, at its inner end preferably, with a spray-nozzle g, as shown in Fig. 4. The outer end of said water-supply pipe is suitably connected, preferably by a rubber tube Or, to a V-pipe G to hot and cold water supply pipes H and H, provided with cut-offs h 7L, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3. To the lower end of the compartment D is connected a discharge-pipe I, providedv with a cook or cut-ofl\u0026#39; 1\u0026#39;. The outer end of the pipe I is connected by a flexible rubber pipe K to a washboard supply-pipe L, adapted to be fitted in recesses m m in the sides of the washboard M, as shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 5. The under side of the washboard supply-pipe L is provided with perforationsZ I, through which the liquid is discharged onto the washboard and the clothes\u0026#39;during the operation of washing the latter. One end of said supply-pipe L is closed, as shown in the left-hand end of Fig. 5, the other end being connected to the pipe K, as shown in said Fig. 5. To the closed end of the perforated pipe L is attached a suitable hook I, by means of which said pipe can readily be attached to the side of the washboard. To the other end of the pipeL is connected a longitudinally-adjustable hook 6\u0026#34;, by means of which the other end can be connected to the washboard, according to the width of the latter.  \n  Near the upper end of the lower water-compartment D are diametrically-opposed overflow or discharge openings (6\u0026#34;, of which the one facing the set tub is normally kept open to allow the excess of the liquid in the compartment D to be discharged in the set tub. The opposite discharge-opening (Wis normally held closed by a suitable cap or stopper cl.  \n (Shown in Fig. 1.) In the bottom of the set tub is the usual discharge or drain pipe a, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3.  \n  In using the device the upper compartment D is filled with soapy water or a soapy solution, and the lower compartment containshot or cold water, as may be desired. The washboard is placed in the set tub, as shown, and the perforated wash-pipe L is attached to the washboard and to the tube K, connected to the lower compartment D, as described. \\Vhile the clothes are rubbed on the washboard hot or cold water may be supplied thereto for rinsing purposes by closing the valve F, or a soapy solution can be applied to the clothes by opening the said valve F and the valve 2 causing the soapy solution from the compartment D to pass through the perforations ff (,Z into thelower compartment and become thoroughly mixed to the desired degree with such hot or cold water in the lower compartment and discharged through the perforated pipe L onto the clothes and wash board. The soapy solution and water are thus caused to intermingle by agitation before being supplied to the washboard during the washing operation.  \n  The advantage of this apparatus is that a regulated supply of hot or cold water can be conveyed to the washboard during the washing operation. The supply of the water or soapy solution can be regulated according to the size of the washing.  \n  I dispense with the labor of supplying soap by hand, as the soapy water is automatically fed to the washboard. The strength of such soapy solution can readily be regulated by the valve and cut-ofl\u0026#39; to cleanse all kind of garments, and the temperature of the water or solution can be regulated for the harmless washing of woolens and fabrics of delicate colors.  \n  \\Vhen not in use, the tank can be detached and placed in the set tub, as shown in dotted lines in Figs. 1 and 3.  \n  Having thus described the invention, what is claimed as new is 1. In a liquid-supply apparatus, a tank divided vertically into an upper and lower compartment, a valve arranged between the upper and lower compartments, a hot and cold.  \n water supply pipe communicating with the lower compartment, a regulating cut-oil attached to the latter, and a perforated deliver ypipe attached to said tank, substantially as set forth.  \n  2.

De Vrro, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Boston, in the county of Suffolk and State of hlassachusetts, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Liquid-Supply Apparatus for ashboards, of which the following is a specilication. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates to improvements in liquid-supply apparatus for washboards; and it has for its object the washing of clothes with hot or cold water with or without liquid soap or soapy water supplied to the washboard, as will be hereinafter more fully shown and described, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is afront elevation of the apparatus, showing the set washtub in section. Fig. 2 is a partial top plan view of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a vertical section on the line 3 3 shown in Fig. 1. Fig. A is an enlarged section on the line 4 c shown in Fig. l, and Fig. 5 is an enlarged cross-section on the line 5 5 shown in Fig. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Similar letters refer to similar parts wherever they occur on the diiferent parts of the drawings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the drawings, A represents a set washtub secured to the wall B, as usual. To one end of the set tub is detachably secured a suitable bracket O, preferably hooked over the end of the tub, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Upon said bracket is detachably supported a tank D, divided, by means of a diaphragm (Z, into an upper compartment D and a lower compartment D. The upper compartment D contains a soapy solution E, and the lower compartment D contains hot or cold water E\", as shown in Fig. 4:. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e (Z is a removable cover on top of the tank D, which maybe removed when filling the compartment l)\" with the soapy solution. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Above the diaphragm (Z is arranged within the compartment 1) a delivery-pipe F, provided with exitsff, coinciding with a perforation (1 in the diaphragm (Z, as shown, for the purpose of discharging part of the contents of the soapy solution E into the water E\", as shown in Fig. i. \\Vithin the pipe F is arranged a slide-valve F, which when drawn out, as shown in Fig. 4, allows the soapy solution E to pass out through the perforations f f and d into the lower water compartment D for mixing it with the Wa' ter E contained in the lower compartment, as shown in Fig. 4. When it is desired to close the supply from the upper to the lower compartment, the valve-stem F is pushed in, so as to close the orifices connecting the upper and lower compartments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \\Vithin the upper part of the lower compartment is located a water-supply pipe Gr, provided, at its inner end preferably, with a spray-nozzle g, as shown in Fig. 4. The outer end of said water-supply pipe is suitably connected, preferably by a rubber tube Or, to a V-pipe G to hot and cold water supply pipes H and H, provided with cut-offs h 7L, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3. To the lower end of the compartment D is connected a discharge-pipe I, providedv with a cook or cut-ofl' 1'. The outer end of the pipe I is connected by a flexible rubber pipe K to a washboard supply-pipe L, adapted to be fitted in recesses m m in the sides of the washboard M, as shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 5. The under side of the washboard supply-pipe L is provided with perforationsZ I, through which the liquid is discharged onto the washboard and the clothes'during the operation of washing the latter. One end of said supply-pipe L is closed, as shown in the left-hand end of Fig. 5, the other end being connected to the pipe K, as shown in said Fig. 5. To the closed end of the perforated pipe L is attached a suitable hook I, by means of which said pipe can readily be attached to the side of the washboard. To the other end of the pipeL is connected a longitudinally-adjustable hook 6\", by means of which the other end can be connected to the washboard, according to the width of the latter. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Near the upper end of the lower water-compartment D are diametrically-opposed overflow or discharge openings (6\", of which the one facing the set tub is normally kept open to allow the excess of the liquid in the compartment D to be discharged in the set tub. The opposite discharge-opening (Wis normally held closed by a suitable cap or stopper cl. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Shown in Fig. 1.) In the bottom of the set tub is the usual discharge or drain pipe a, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In using the device the upper compartment D is filled with soapy water or a soapy solution, and the lower compartment containshot or cold water, as may be desired. The washboard is placed in the set tub, as shown, and the perforated wash-pipe L is attached to the washboard and to the tube K, connected to the lower compartment D, as described. \\Vhile the clothes are rubbed on the washboard hot or cold water may be supplied thereto for rinsing purposes by closing the valve F, or a soapy solution can be applied to the clothes by opening the said valve F and the valve 2 causing the soapy solution from the compartment D to pass through the perforations ff (,Z into thelower compartment and become thoroughly mixed to the desired degree with such hot or cold water in the lower compartment and discharged through the perforated pipe L onto the clothes and wash board. The soapy solution and water are thus caused to intermingle by agitation before being supplied to the washboard during the washing operation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The advantage of this apparatus is that a regulated supply of hot or cold water can be conveyed to the washboard during the washing operation. The supply of the water or soapy solution can be regulated according to the size of the washing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e I dispense with the labor of supplying soap by hand, as the soapy water is automatically fed to the washboard. The strength of such soapy solution can readily be regulated by the valve and cut-ofl' to cleanse all kind of garments, and the temperature of the water or solution can be regulated for the harmless washing of woolens and fabrics of delicate colors. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \\Vhen not in use, the tank can be detached and placed in the set tub, as shown in dotted lines in Figs. 1 and 3. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus described the invention, what is claimed as new is 1. In a liquid-supply apparatus, a tank divided vertically into an upper and lower compartment, a valve arranged between the upper and lower compartments, a hot and cold. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewater supply pipe communicating with the lower compartment, a regulating cut-oil attached to the latter, and a perforated deliver ypipe attached to said tank, substantially as set forth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 2.

NAGEL, a citizen of the United States, residing at Vicksburg. in the county of Warren, State of Mississippi, have invented certain new and useful lmprovemen ts in Squares; and li do hereby declare the following\u0026#39; to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it ap pertains to make and use the same.  \n  This invention relates to bevels; and it has for its object to providea construction which may be adjusted for use as an ordinary square or as a bevel, a further object of the invention being to provide a construction which will be cheap, simple, and durable and may be quickly and accurately adjusted.  \n  ln the drawings forming a portion of this specification, and in which like numerals of re ference indicate similar parts in the several views, Figure 1 is a top plan View of a square embodying\u0026#39; the present invention. Fig. 2 is a section on line 2 2 of Fig. 1. 3 is a section on line 3 3 of Fig. 1.  \n Referring now to the drawings, the presentV tool comprises a central plate 5, which forms what may be termed the stem of the square and which is provided with a longitudinal slot (i, extending throughouta portion of its length and for a purpose to be presently explained. The plate 5 is tapered at one end and to this tapered end portion against opposite faces thereof are pivoted arms 7 and 8, which are T-shaped in cross-section, as illustrated, the stems of the arms being disposed against the plate 5, while the head flanges are at right angles to the upper and lower faces of the plate. rlhehead `(langes of the arms terminate short ofthe pivoted ends of the arms, so that said arms may be folded close against the side edges of the plate 5.  \n  Upon the plate 5 is slidablymounted a sleeve 9, having spaced ears 10 at each side thereof and between which at each side of the plate is pivoted a link 11 and l2, respectively, said links being pivoted at their outer ends against the stems of the arms 7 and 8, respectively, so that as the sleeve 9 is reciprocated upon the plate 5 the arms 7 and 8 are swung toward and away from said plate, so that they will lie at various angles to cach other. \u0026#39;lhe upper and lower sides of the sleeve 9 are of suilicient resiliency to permit themto be drawn toward each other against the plate 5 to hold the sleeve against movementon the plate. To thus clamp the sleeve to the plate 5, a thu nib-screw 15 is engaged loosely through the upper side of the sleeve and is screwed into the lower side of the sleeve, so that by adjusting the screw in one direction the sides of the sleeve will be brought together and by adjusting it in the opposite direction the sides of the sleeve will be released.  \n  It will be noted that with the construction presented there is produced a tool which has great rigidity and durability.  \n  The plate 5 is marked on the upper face near the slot 6 with a scale from which the sleeve 9 travels, the sleeve with the scale indicating the angle at which the arms 7 and 8 lie. lit will be noted that the scale comprises four long markings, 20, 21, 22, and 23, which indicate, respectively, where to set the sleeve in order that the arms may lie at an angle corresponding to two sides of a square, a pentagon, a\u0026#39; hexagon, and an octagon, respectively. The member 5 always bisccts the angle between the arms. The long marks referred to are at one side of the slot. Between the long marks referred to are shorter marks 25, which in connection with the long marks form a pitch-scale and show the pitch of the bevel that is, they indicate the rise in inches to the foot. lt will ofcourse be understood that one scale may be on one side of the plate and the other scale on the other side.  \n  It will be of course understood\u0026#39;that when the thumb-screw 15 is operated the sleeve will not only be compressed upon the plate 5 but also upon the links A11 and 12, so that all parts will be held securely against movement with respect to each other.  \n What is claimed is- A square consisting of a plate 5 having a longitudinal slot therein and scales at opposite sides of the slot, a com prcssible sleeve 9 slidu ably mounted upon the slotted plate, said sleeve including spaced ears, links 11 and 12 pivoted between the ears at opposite sides of the plate, cross-sectional T-shaped arms 7 and 8 pivotecl to one end of the slotted plete and In testimony whereof I affix my signature in pivoted to the links respectively, and a thumbpresence of two Witnesses.  \n Screw passed loosely through one side of the sleeve and through the slotted plete and screwed into the opposite plate and adapted to Witnesses: compress the sleeve against the slotted plate JOHN C.

NAGEL, a citizen of the United States, residing at Vicksburg. in the county of Warren, State of Mississippi, have invented certain new and useful lmprovemen ts in Squares; and li do hereby declare the following' to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it ap pertains to make and use the same. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates to bevels; and it has for its object to providea construction which may be adjusted for use as an ordinary square or as a bevel, a further object of the invention being to provide a construction which will be cheap, simple, and durable and may be quickly and accurately adjusted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e ln the drawings forming a portion of this specification, and in which like numerals of re ference indicate similar parts in the several views, Figure 1 is a top plan View of a square embodying' the present invention. Fig. 2 is a section on line 2 2 of Fig. 1. 3 is a section on line 3 3 of Fig. 1. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferring now to the drawings, the presentV tool comprises a central plate 5, which forms what may be termed the stem of the square and which is provided with a longitudinal slot (i, extending throughouta portion of its length and for a purpose to be presently explained. The plate 5 is tapered at one end and to this tapered end portion against opposite faces thereof are pivoted arms 7 and 8, which are T-shaped in cross-section, as illustrated, the stems of the arms being disposed against the plate 5, while the head flanges are at right angles to the upper and lower faces of the plate. rlhehead `(langes of the arms terminate short ofthe pivoted ends of the arms, so that said arms may be folded close against the side edges of the plate 5. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Upon the plate 5 is slidablymounted a sleeve 9, having spaced ears 10 at each side thereof and between which at each side of the plate is pivoted a link 11 and l2, respectively, said links being pivoted at their outer ends against the stems of the arms 7 and 8, respectively, so that as the sleeve 9 is reciprocated upon the plate 5 the arms 7 and 8 are swung toward and away from said plate, so that they will lie at various angles to cach other. 'lhe upper and lower sides of the sleeve 9 are of suilicient resiliency to permit themto be drawn toward each other against the plate 5 to hold the sleeve against movementon the plate. To thus clamp the sleeve to the plate 5, a thu nib-screw 15 is engaged loosely through the upper side of the sleeve and is screwed into the lower side of the sleeve, so that by adjusting the screw in one direction the sides of the sleeve will be brought together and by adjusting it in the opposite direction the sides of the sleeve will be released. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be noted that with the construction presented there is produced a tool which has great rigidity and durability. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The plate 5 is marked on the upper face near the slot 6 with a scale from which the sleeve 9 travels, the sleeve with the scale indicating the angle at which the arms 7 and 8 lie. lit will be noted that the scale comprises four long markings, 20, 21, 22, and 23, which indicate, respectively, where to set the sleeve in order that the arms may lie at an angle corresponding to two sides of a square, a pentagon, a' hexagon, and an octagon, respectively. The member 5 always bisccts the angle between the arms. The long marks referred to are at one side of the slot. Between the long marks referred to are shorter marks 25, which in connection with the long marks form a pitch-scale and show the pitch of the bevel that is, they indicate the rise in inches to the foot. lt will ofcourse be understood that one scale may be on one side of the plate and the other scale on the other side. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be of course understood'that when the thumb-screw 15 is operated the sleeve will not only be compressed upon the plate 5 but also upon the links A11 and 12, so that all parts will be held securely against movement with respect to each other. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is claimed is- A square consisting of a plate 5 having a longitudinal slot therein and scales at opposite sides of the slot, a com prcssible sleeve 9 slidu ably mounted upon the slotted plate, said sleeve including spaced ears, links 11 and 12 pivoted between the ears at opposite sides of the plate, cross-sectional T-shaped arms 7 and 8 pivotecl to one end of the slotted plete and In testimony whereof I affix my signature in pivoted to the links respectively, and a thumbpresence of two Witnesses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew passed loosely through one side of the sleeve and through the slotted plete and screwed into the opposite plate and adapted to Witnesses: compress the sleeve against the slotted plate JOHN C.

Serial No. 239,214.  \n T0 (0Z7, whom, it may concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, HARRY G. RUSH, a citizen of the United States, residing at Dawson, in the county of Fayette and State of Pennsylvania, have invented anew and useful Step- Ladder, of which the following is a specification.  \n  The invention relates to improvements in step-ladders.  \n  The object of the present invention is to improve the construction of step-ladders and to provide a simple and comparatively inexpensive one of great strength and durability adapted in addition to performing the func tions of an ordinary step-ladder to be used on sloping ground, stairways, and other uneven surfaces.  \n  A further object of the invention is to provide a foldable step-ladder of this character capable of ready adjustment to vary the length of its leg for adapting it to the character of the place in which it is to be used.  \n  WVith these and other objects in view the invention consists in the construction and novel combination and arrangement of parts hereinafter fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings, and pointed out in the claims hereto appended, it being understood that various changes in the form, proportion, size, and minor details of construction within the scope of the claims may be resorted to without departing from the spirit or sacrificing any of the advantages of the invention.  \n  In the drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of a step-ladder constructed in accordance with this invention. Fig. 2 is a vertical longitudinal sectional View of the upper portion of the ladder. Fig. 3 is a transverse sectional view illustrating the arrangement of the parts when the hinged shelf is folded. Fig. 4 is a rear elevation, partly in section, of the central portion of the leg, illustrating the construction for adjustably connecting the upper and lower sections of the same- Fig. 5 is a detail sectional view on the line 5 5 of Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a detail perspective view of the pivotal support for the hinged shelf.  \n  Like numerals of reference designate corresponding parts in all the figures of the drawings.  \n  1 designates the ladder proper, which is composed of sides 2 and connecting-steps 3. The front member or ladder proper may be of any desired construction, and it is supported in an inclined position by a rear leg 4:, composed of upper and lower sections 5 and 6, which are slidably connected and which are capable of adjustment to vary the length of the rear leg to enable the step-ladder to be firmly placed on sloping or other uneven ground, on stairs, and any analogous places; but the step-ladder is adapted to perform all functions of an ordinary step-ladder. The upper section 5 is composed of parallel side bars 7, hinged at their upper ends to the front member or ladder proper by means of a pintle 8, which pierces the side bars 7 and the rear ends of a pair of cleats 9. The cleats 9 are secured to the lower face of the top step or platform 10 of the ladder l. The parallel side bars 7 are braced by oppositely-inclined bars 11, crossed at the center and secured at their ends to the parallel side bars at the terminals thereof. The bars or braces 11 are recessed at their point of crossing to arrange them in the same transverse plane as the parallel side bars 7.  \n  The lower section 6 is provided with outer inclined supporting-bars 12 and inner parallel slidable bars 13, secured at their upper ends to the inclined bars 12 and connected with the latter near their, lower \u0026#39;ends by a transverse bar 14:. The bars 12 converge toward their upper ends and form a lower tapering section for the leg, which presents a broad base to the supporting-surface. The lower endsof the outer upwardly-converging bars of the lower section extend below the inner straight bars 13 and form the supporting portions for the legs of the step-ladder.  \n  The upper and lower sections are slidably connected with each other by means of guides 15 and 16. The upper guides 15, which consist of substantially rectangular boxes, receive and embrace the parallel bars of the upper and lower sections and are secured by suitable fastening devices to the bars 13 of the lower slidable section. The other guides 16, which are elongated, are substantially rectangular in cross-section and receive the parallel bars, being secured to the bars 7 of the upper section by suitable fastening devices. These lower guides are provided with perforations receiving pins or keys 17, adapted to engage the parallel bars of the lower section, and the latter are provided at intervals with perforations 18, adapted to register with the perforations of the guides, whereby the sections of the leg are secured in their adjustment. The parallel bars of the upper section are connected by inner and outer cross-bars 19 and 20, arranged as clearly shown in Fig. 4 of the drawings. The cross-bar 19 is extended laterally beyond the side bars of the upper section and are connected by foldable braces 21 with the front member or ladder 1. The foldable braces are composed of two sections or members pivoted together at their inner ends and similarly secured at their outer ends to the front member or ladder 1 and the leg 4:. The inner ends of one of the members of each brace is extended beyond the pivot and is provided with a lug 22 for engaging the other member for limiting the downward movement of the said members when the parts are arranged horizontally, as illustrated in Fig. 1 of the drawings. By this construction the pivoted members are adapted to form a rigid brace for connecting the front member or ladder proper and the leg.  \n  The step-ladder is provided at the back with a shelf 23, connected by hinges 24 to a crossbar 25, which is secured to the side bars 7, near the upper ends thereof. This shelf, which is adapted to fold against the bars 5, is maintained in a horizontal position by an upright pivotally-mounted support 26. The support 26, which extends outward from a pintle-rod 27, is substantially triangular and is constructed of suitable metal and may be either formed integral with the pintle-rod or be secured to the same by any suitable means. The support presents a horizontal upper edge to the shelf when it is extended, as shown in Fig. 2. The pintle-rod, which extends above and below the support, is arranged in suitable bearings 28 and 29. The lower bearing consists of a substantially L-shaped bracket or plate secured to the cross bars or braces 11 by a fastening device 30, which passes through the said bars or braces 11 at their point of crossing. The fastening device 30, which preferably consists of a bolt, serves to fasten the bars or braces 11 together in addition to securing the bearing-bracket to the same. The upper and lower ends of the pintle-rod are bent to form arms 31 and 32, extending outward from the said pintle-rod at right angles to each other and forming stops for limiting the movement of the support. The arm 31 at the upper end of the pintle-rod limits the movement of the support in one direction when the said support is in its extended or operative position and the lower arm limits the movement of the support when the same is in its folded position.  \n  Having thus fully described my invention what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-  \n  1. A step-ladder provided with a leg, comprising an upper section having an extended cross-bar, a lower section slidably connected with the upper section,-means\u0026#39;for securing the sections in their adjustment, and a foldable brace connected with the extended portion of the cross-bar.  \n  2.

Serial No. 265,923.  \n To all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, CHARLES P. BLINN, of Boston, in the county of Sudolk and State of Massachusetts, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Pianoforte-Agrades, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention has for its object to provide a pianoforte-agrade adapted to support the string or strings engaged with it without liability of being indented by the said string or strings.  \n  Ordinarily a pianoforte-agrade, which is usually made of brass, is formed so that the string bears with considerable force against the metal of the agrade, the result being that the agrade is so indented by the vibrations of the string that an objectionable buzzing sound occurs at the agrade when the string is vibrating. Moreover, the tension of the string is decreased by the indentation of the agrade, so that it is thrown out of tune.  \n  l overcome the above-recited objections by the improvement which I will now proceed to describe and claim.  \n  Of the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this specification, Figure l represents a side elevation showingmyimproved agrade and a sectional view of a portion of the frame of a pianoforte. Figs. 2 and 3 represent elevations of the agrade removed from the frame. Fig. 4L represents an enlarged section on line t L of Fig. 3.  \n  The same reference characters indicate the same parts in all the figures.  \n  My improved agrade comprises the body portion 5, having a screw-threaded shank 6 to engage a threaded socket formed for its reception in the frame of the pianoforte. In one side of the body of the agrade is formed a recess 7, extending across the body, the upper portion of the agrade projecting over the recess and being provided with a\u0026#39;seat 8, which overhangs the recess 7.  \n  The agrade is provided with one or more string-oriiices 9, three being shown in the present ease. These oridces extend from the surface of the agrade which forms the inner end of the recess 7 to the opposite side of the agrade, as shown in Fig. 4:. Each orifice 9 is made of considerably greater diameter than the string l0,which passes through the orifice.  \n  l2 represents a rest, which is a short piece of hard metal, preferably iron or steel, and is formed to closely dt the seat 8, The rest l2 is preferably of cylindrical form, and its diameter is such that a string bearing against its under side will be supported entirely by the rest and will exert no appreciable pressure upon the wall of the orifice 9 through which it passes. Preferably the string will be entirely out of contact with the wall of the orifice; but whether this is the case or not the support adorded by the rest will prevent the string\u0026#39; from exerting suiiicient pressure on the portion of the agrade through which it passes to cause indentation of the relatively soft metal of the agrade by the vibrations of the string, the agrade being ordinarily made of brass.  \n  The rest l2 is detachable from the agrade and is held in the position shown in the drawings bythe tension of the string, which presses the agrade against the seat 8.  \n  The described improvement prevents any liability of wear or indentation of the agrade tending to vary the tension and tune of the string\u0026#39; or cause a buzzing sound where the string passes through the agrade.  \n  It will be seen that the rest presents a smooth rounded surface of hard metal to the string which permits the string to render or move endwise more freely on the agrade in turning than would be the case if the bearing of the string were on the brass body of the agrade. Hence the turning of the string is edected more easily and satisfactorily than when the ordinary agrade is employed. Moreover, when two or more strings are passed through each agrade the rest insures a uniform height of the strings, whereas in the ordinary agrade there is liable to be a slight variation in the height of the strings owing to the didiculty of drilling two or more holes at exactly the saine height. Uniformity in the height of the strings is very desirable, as a slight variation will cause a corresponding Variation in the effect of the blows ofthe tension, and preventing indenting Contact he- IO hammers on the strings. tween the string and the body of the agi-atie.

Serial No. 263,402.  \n To (I\u0026#39;ll: who/1t it may concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, CHARLES F. BINGHAM, a citizen of the United States. residing at Buffalo, in the county of Erie and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Brake-Shoes, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention relates to a railway brakeshoe of that class in which the shoe is strength sued by one or more reinforcements embedded in the cast body of the shoe.  \n  The object of the invention is to lock the reinforcement in the body against removal therefrom in a downward direction until the shoe is worn sufiiciently thin to almost entirely wear out the reinforcement. This is attained by making the sides of the reinforcement so that they taper or converge toward each other from the top downward, thereby giving the reinforcement a wedge shape in cross-section with the greater width at the top. I hen the body of the shoe is cast around the reinforcement, tapering or converging side walls corresponding to the tapering sides of the reinforcementarc formed in the socket around the reinforcement, thereby providing a dovetailed socket in which the reinforcement is wedged against downward movement. form of reinforcement is locked in the body against downward removal until the shoe is worn sufficiently thin to entirely wear out the reinforcement, or nearly so.  \n  This invention also relates to certain details of construction. all of which will be fully and clearl y hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which a preferred adaptation of the invention is shown.  \n  Figure 1 is a vertical longitudinal section through the improved brake-shoe on line a a, Fig. 3. Fig. Qisalongitudinal section through the improved brake-shoe cut on the curved line 7) 7), Fig. 1, concentric with the curved braking-surface of the shoe. Fig. 3 is an enlarged transverse section through the improved brake-shoe on line cc, Fig. 1. Fig. 4c is an enlarged transverse section through the brake-shoe, showing another form of reinforcement. Fig. 5 is an enlarged cross-section through one form of reinforcing-rod. Fig.  \n 6 is an enlarged cross-section through another form of reinforclng-rod.  \n In referrmg to the drawings for the details This drop or be detached therefrom until the shoe is nearly worn out or is unfit for further use.  \n  The preferred adaptation of this improved brake-shoe comprises a cast body 1 of the usual shape and two reinforcinga\u0026#39;ods 2. These rods are of similar construction and each having a fairly wide top face, a narrow bottom face, and two tapering sides which converge from the top to the bottom, so that the rods are approximately in the form of a keystone in cross-section. In the sectional view of the rod in Fig. 5 the top face is designated by the numeral 3, the bottom face by the numeral st, and the sides by the numeral 5 for the purpose of clearly (.listinguishing them. in the form shown in Fig. 6 the rod is of triangular shape, with one of the faces 6 constituting the horizontal top surface of the rod and the two other faces 7 and 8 the tapering sides.  \n  The rods 2 when embedded in the cast body 1 are wedged therein until nearly worn out and cannot drop or be removed therefrom until the shoe is worn sufiicieutly thin to entirely expose them.  \n  The top corners at the junction of the top face and the tapering sides of the reinforcing rod are sufficiently sharp to weld fairly well with the molten metal of the body even when the reinforcing-rod is placed in the mold in a cold condition.  \n  lncasting this improved brake-shoe the reinforcing rods are placed in position in a suitable mold and the molten metal poured therein and around the reinforcing-rods. The great advantage of this construction is that the reinforcing-rod is locked in the cast body until the body is too thin for safe use, which is due to the tapering form in cross-section of the reinforcingrod and the wedging of the same inf the dovetail socket in the body, both the socket and rod constantly broadening from the bottom upward to the top, so that the rod is wedge-locked between the two side walls of the socket, which diverge gradually from each other throughout their width from the bottom of the socket upward to the top termination of the side walls.  \n I claim as my invention-- 1. A shoe of the class described, consisting of a cast body and a reinforcing-rod completely wedge-locked in said body.  \n  2. In abrake-shoe, areinforcing-rod having sides tapering throughout from the top downward and a body cast around said rod.  \n  3. In a brake-shoe, a reinforcing-rod having sides converging toward each other from the top downward and a body cast around said rod.  \n  4.

BINGHAM, a citizen of the United States. residing at Buffalo, in the county of Erie and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Brake-Shoes, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates to a railway brakeshoe of that class in which the shoe is strength sued by one or more reinforcements embedded in the cast body of the shoe. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The object of the invention is to lock the reinforcement in the body against removal therefrom in a downward direction until the shoe is worn sufiiciently thin to almost entirely wear out the reinforcement. This is attained by making the sides of the reinforcement so that they taper or converge toward each other from the top downward, thereby giving the reinforcement a wedge shape in cross-section with the greater width at the top. I hen the body of the shoe is cast around the reinforcement, tapering or converging side walls corresponding to the tapering sides of the reinforcementarc formed in the socket around the reinforcement, thereby providing a dovetailed socket in which the reinforcement is wedged against downward movement. form of reinforcement is locked in the body against downward removal until the shoe is worn sufficiently thin to entirely wear out the reinforcement, or nearly so. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention also relates to certain details of construction. all of which will be fully and clearl y hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which a preferred adaptation of the invention is shown. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Figure 1 is a vertical longitudinal section through the improved brake-shoe on line a a, Fig. 3. Fig. Qisalongitudinal section through the improved brake-shoe cut on the curved line 7) 7), Fig. 1, concentric with the curved braking-surface of the shoe. Fig. 3 is an enlarged transverse section through the improved brake-shoe on line cc, Fig. 1. Fig. 4c is an enlarged transverse section through the brake-shoe, showing another form of reinforcement. Fig. 5 is an enlarged cross-section through one form of reinforcing-rod. Fig. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6 is an enlarged cross-section through another form of reinforclng-rod. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn referrmg to the drawings for the details This drop or be detached therefrom until the shoe is nearly worn out or is unfit for further use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The preferred adaptation of this improved brake-shoe comprises a cast body 1 of the usual shape and two reinforcinga'ods 2. These rods are of similar construction and each having a fairly wide top face, a narrow bottom face, and two tapering sides which converge from the top to the bottom, so that the rods are approximately in the form of a keystone in cross-section. In the sectional view of the rod in Fig. 5 the top face is designated by the numeral 3, the bottom face by the numeral st, and the sides by the numeral 5 for the purpose of clearly (.listinguishing them. in the form shown in Fig. 6 the rod is of triangular shape, with one of the faces 6 constituting the horizontal top surface of the rod and the two other faces 7 and 8 the tapering sides. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The rods 2 when embedded in the cast body 1 are wedged therein until nearly worn out and cannot drop or be removed therefrom until the shoe is worn sufiicieutly thin to entirely expose them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The top corners at the junction of the top face and the tapering sides of the reinforcing rod are sufficiently sharp to weld fairly well with the molten metal of the body even when the reinforcing-rod is placed in the mold in a cold condition. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e lncasting this improved brake-shoe the reinforcing rods are placed in position in a suitable mold and the molten metal poured therein and around the reinforcing-rods. The great advantage of this construction is that the reinforcing-rod is locked in the cast body until the body is too thin for safe use, which is due to the tapering form in cross-section of the reinforcingrod and the wedging of the same inf the dovetail socket in the body, both the socket and rod constantly broadening from the bottom upward to the top, so that the rod is wedge-locked between the two side walls of the socket, which diverge gradually from each other throughout their width from the bottom of the socket upward to the top termination of the side walls. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI claim as my invention-- 1.

Fig. 2 is an enlarged cross-section on the line 2 2 of Fig. 1. Figs. 3 and 4 are longitudinal sections on the lines 3 3 and 4 4 of Fig. 1, the threads or strands composing the fabric being shown widely separated for the purpose of better illustration.  \n  The ground or body portion of the fabric is composed of warp-threads 1 and thick or heavy weft 2. These are interwoven, as will be understood by reference to Figs. 1 and 2, in a well-known manner, such as is practiced in the weaving of ingrain carpets. At intervals in the groundewarp 1 I arrange supplemental warp-threads 3 (see Fig. 1) for the purpose of tying in and securing the top weft 4, which forms the ornamental or better portion of the fabric. The warp-threads 3 are smaller or finer than the ground-Warp 1, and they may be colored for securing a more ornamental effect in the surface of the fabric. It will be understood that the supplemental warp 3 is interwoven with the ordinary weft 2 the same as the ground-warp 1 and that it is interwoven with the top weft 4 in the same way, whereas the ground-warp 1 is not interwoven with the top weft 4, but passes underneath the same, aswill be understood from the drawings. The body of the fabric, composed of the warp 1 and weft 2, is formed of cheap but strong and durable material, such as cotton or jute, and the top portion 4 is composed of better material, such as worsted or in the matter of time and labor, the fabric may be produced at practically the same cost as a fabric composed of materials having a uniform quality or cost. The ornamental effect of the top surface is enhanced by reason of the fact that the silk or worsted weft 4 spans a series of ground-Warp 1, and it is to be noted as an important feature that the heavy Worsted or silk threads composing such weft are drawn down only just enough to properly secure them and not through the body of the fabric, and consequently a certain length of such threads will covermore surface than is possible in other fabrics of the class. In other words, practically the entire length of the heavy worsted or silk threads 4 is floated on the upper side or face of the fabric.  \n  It is to be understood that the weft 4 will ordinarily be colored before being incorporated in the fabric, but that I do not restrict myself to the employment of colored weft.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  A fabric having a warp and weft ground portion constituting the reverse side of the fabric and being of a low-grade material and a warp and weft surface portion constituting the ornamental obverse side of the fabric and being of a high-grade material, the said surface portion having thick ornamental surface threads completely overspreading the said ground portion and each spanning a plurality of the threads of the ground portion, the threads for holding the said thick ornamental surface thread to the ground portion being very thin and interwoven with the ground portion to practically utilize the entire lengths of the said thick-spread ornamental surface threads as the ornamental surface of the obverse side of the fabric.  \n HOVCEP SARAFIAN.  \n Witnesses:  \n AMos W.

B, WATERMAN, of Chicago, in the county oi\u0026#39; Cook, and State of Illinois, hav\u0026#39;e invented certain new and useful Improvements in Clothes-Driers; and I do hereby declare that the following is a i\u0026#39;ull7 clear, and exact description thereof, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, making part 4of this specification, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, like letters indicating like parts wherever they occur.  \n To enable others skilled in the art to construct and use my invention, I will proceed to describe it.  \n  My invention consists in a novel construction of a clothes-drying frame, whereby the frame maybe attached to or detached from the pipe of a stove, as hereinafter more fully explained\u0026#39;.  \n Figure l-is a topplan view, and  \n Figure 2 is a side elevation, representing the frame detached and folded up to be set away.  \n In the preparation of clothing it is desirable to have a frame convenient for hanging the-u1 on while drying, i  \n and which shall occupy as little space as possible in the room, and that can be readily hung up or packed away: when not in use. These objects I accomplish by so constructing the frame that it can be readily attachedcto and supported by the pipe of an ordinary stove, and which can be readily detached, compactlyfolded, and hung np when not desired for use.  \n  To make my improved device, I construct a light iron frame or collar, consisting of two semicircular pieces, A, and hinge them together at one end, as represented in fig. k1, the hinge-joint being shown at e. Those pieces A have a series of lugs or ears, ncast on their exterior face, these ears being arranged in pairs, at a proper distance apart to permit a bar, B, to be pivoted between-each-pair, by means of a pin, d, which passes through both ears and the end of the bar.  \n  The bars B have their ends f ormcd as represented in fig. 2, so that when spread out as shown in fig. 1; the point I, which forms theirlower shoulder, will strike or bear against the lower portion\u0026#39; of the pieces A, and thus hold them rigidly in position, their upper shoulders being rounded o\u0026#39;, to permit the bars to be folded upward and inward, as shown in g. 2, it being there represented upside down, or in the reverse position from what it Aoccupies when attached to the pipe.  \n  To thebar B is pivoted a brace, 6, of proper length, to bear against the bar B\u0026#34;, on the opposite side of the joint e,`the end ofthe brace resting against a metal piece, c, secured to the side ofthe bar B, this piece c being provided with notches forholding the brace firmly in position, and preventing it from slipping or becoming accidentally displaced.  \n  Instead of thc notched piece c, a .strip of rubber may be secured to theside of the bar B, and the end of the brace b be allowed to rest against it, the friction and yielding surface of the rubber being Asuiiicient to hold the brace securely in place; or, if preferred, a piece of rubber may be secured in any suitable manner to the end of the brace itself, in such a position thutit will bear against the bar B when the brace is placed in` position. 4  \n  The semicircular bars \u0026#39;or pieces A are made of such a-size, that when arranged in position they will form something less than an entire circle, so that they may besecured to pipes of various sizes, the\u0026#39;hinge e being so constructed as to permit the pieces A to be pressed together, so as to clasp the pipe, and beheld against it\u0026#39; by the brace b, suiciently tightvto hold the frame securely, in place.  \n  In constructing the pieces A, Isometimcs form them with a small Astrip, connecting each pair of earsV n, this strip being formed on the top of the ears, \u0026#39;and extending across from one to the other ofthe pair, thus forming a iiange or shoulder at the point where the ears join the bands A, against whichthe upper side of the bars B may. rest, and thusv assist to brace them more firmly in place when spread out. l  \n  To apply it, it is only necessary to open the bands and clasp them around the pipe, and then secure it firmly Vthere by the brace b. Being directly above the stove, the ascending currents \u0026#39;of hot air will dry the clothes rapidly, and in much less time than can be done with the ordinary elothes-frames which stand about the room. At the sametime they are more out ot the way, and thus utilize a space otherwise of little or no avail.  \n Having thus described my invention, what I claim, is-  \n  A detachable clothes-drier, consisting ofthev hinged arranged to be secured to a stove-pipe by means ofthe brace or pawl b, and the ratchet; or its equivalent of rubber,as herein described.  \n ` L.

Those pieces A have a series of lugs or ears, ncast on their exterior face, these ears being arranged in pairs, at a proper distance apart to permit a bar, B, to be pivoted between-each-pair, by means of a pin, d, which passes through both ears and the end of the bar. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The bars B have their ends f ormcd as represented in fig. 2, so that when spread out as shown in fig. 1; the point I, which forms theirlower shoulder, will strike or bear against the lower portion' of the pieces A, and thus hold them rigidly in position, their upper shoulders being rounded o', to permit the bars to be folded upward and inward, as shown in g. 2, it being there represented upside down, or in the reverse position from what it Aoccupies when attached to the pipe. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To thebar B is pivoted a brace, 6, of proper length, to bear against the bar B\", on the opposite side of the joint e,`the end ofthe brace resting against a metal piece, c, secured to the side ofthe bar B, this piece c being provided with notches forholding the brace firmly in position, and preventing it from slipping or becoming accidentally displaced. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Instead of thc notched piece c, a .strip of rubber may be secured to theside of the bar B, and the end of the brace b be allowed to rest against it, the friction and yielding surface of the rubber being Asuiiicient to hold the brace securely in place; or, if preferred, a piece of rubber may be secured in any suitable manner to the end of the brace itself, in such a position thutit will bear against the bar B when the brace is placed in` position. 4 \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The semicircular bars 'or pieces A are made of such a-size, that when arranged in position they will form something less than an entire circle, so that they may besecured to pipes of various sizes, the'hinge e being so constructed as to permit the pieces A to be pressed together, so as to clasp the pipe, and beheld against it' by the brace b, suiciently tightvto hold the frame securely, in place. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In constructing the pieces A, Isometimcs form them with a small Astrip, connecting each pair of earsV n, this strip being formed on the top of the ears, 'and extending across from one to the other ofthe pair, thus forming a iiange or shoulder at the point where the ears join the bands A, against whichthe upper side of the bars B may. rest, and thusv assist to brace them more firmly in place when spread out. l \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To apply it, it is only necessary to open the bands and clasp them around the pipe, and then secure it firmly Vthere by the brace b. Being directly above the stove, the ascending currents 'of hot air will dry the clothes rapidly, and in much less time than can be done with the ordinary elothes-frames which stand about the room. At the sametime they are more out ot the way, and thus utilize a space otherwise of little or no avail. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving thus described my invention, what I claim, is- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A detachable clothes-drier, consisting ofthev hinged arranged to be secured to a stove-pipe by means ofthe brace or pawl b, and the ratchet; or its equivalent of rubber,as herein described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e` L.

Fig. 2 is a bottom plan view of the same. Fig. 3 is a central longitudinal vertical sectional view; and Fig. 4 is a horizontal sectional View through the handle of the comb, showing the manner of connecting the same. Fig. 5 is a detail elevation of one of the channel-bars.  \n Referring more particularly to the draw ings, 1 denotes the body of the comb, which may be of any suitable construction, but which is preferably formed of a series of channeliron bars, the lower edges of which are formed on a slight upward curve from the center to the outer ends of the same. Said lower curved edges are serrated or provided with teeth 3. The bars 2 are spaced apart at suitable intervals and secured on their upper or back sides to longitudinally-disposed spacing-bars 4 by means of rivets or other suitable connections. To the sides of the channel-bars, near each end of the same, are formed alined apertures 5, through whichare adapted to be inserted the ends of a spring-wire connection 6 for the handle. The free ends of this wire connection 6 after passing through the outer toothbar are bent laterally and around the ends of said bar to form knockers 7 the ends of the wire being formed into an eye and riveted or otherwise secured to the connecting-bars 4, as shown. 7  \n  The spring-wire connection 6 at the inner side of the comb-body 1 is formed into springcoils and from thence projects in the form of a loop 9, which is adapted to be inserted through a suitable handle 10 and to project beyond the end of the same to form an eye 12, by which said comb may be hung up. On the bars of the loop 9, between the eye 12 and the adjacent end of the handle, is arranged a disk or plate 13, in which is formed an elongated aperture of such size as to closely engage the bars of the loop and to hold the sametogether. In applying the handle to the loop 9 of the connection 6 said looped end is inserted through an aperture in the handle and through the elongated aperture in the plate 13, after which the projecting end of the loop is opened or spread to form the eye 12. This opening of the eye will spread the bars of the loop, thus binding the plate 18 against the free end of the handle, which will securely hold the same in place. In the opposite end of the handle, between the wire bars forming the loop, is driven a wedge or key 14:, which serves as an additional means for rigidly connecting the handle with the bars of the spring connection.  \n  A currycomb constructed as herein shown and described will be found to possess many advantages over the common form of comb and may be manufactured at less cost than many forms of comb now in use.  \n  From the foregoing description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, the construction and operation of the invention will be readily understood without requiring a more extended explanation.  \n  Various changes in the form, proportion, and the minor details of construction may be resorted to without departing from the principle or sacrificing any of the advantages of this invention.  \n  Having thus described my invention, what Iclaim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-  \n  1. In adevice of the character described, the combination with the comb-body of a handle, a spring connection between said comb and said Ioo handle and knockers formed by a\u0026#39;continuation of said spring connection, substantially as described.  \n  2.

Serial No. 2 H,791.  \n To all whom it may concern:  \n  Be it known that LMrLns K. LEWIS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Lompoc, in the county of Santa Barbara and State of California, have invented a new and useful Wire-Stretcher, of which the following is a specification. y  \n  The invention relates to improvements in wire-stretchers.  \n  The object of the present invention is to improve the construction of wire-stretchers and to provide asimple and comparatively inexpensive device of great strength and durability capable of simultaneously stretching all ofthe wires of a fence and of automatically maintaining the wires at a uniform tension and of permitting the\u0026#39;same to expand and contract under the varying conditions of the atmosphere and the changes in the temperature without breaking.  \n  With these and other objects in view the invention consists in the construction and novel combination and arrangement of parts hereinafter fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawing, and pointed out in the claims hereto appended, it being understood that various changes in the form, pro  \n portion, size, and minor details of construcinvention.  \n  The figure of the drawing is an elevation of a portion of a fence provided with a wirestretcher constructed in accordance with this invention.  \n  Referring to the drawing, 1 1 designate posts or uprights spaced apart and connected near their upper ends by a horizontal top bar 2, which is interposed between the posts or uprights and which prevents the same from being drawn inward toward each other. The posts or uprights, which constitute a supporting-frame for levers 3, are braced by oppositely-disposed diagonally-arranged wires 4, crossing each other at or near the center of the supporting-frame and secured at their upper ends to the posts or uprights by staples or any other suitable means and connected at their lower ends to suitable anchors 5, which may consist of a block of stone or other suitable material embedded in the ground.  \n  The wire-stretcher is arranged at a point between the ends of a fence, and the adjacent ends 6 of the fence-wires are connected to vertical stretcher-bars 7, which may be constructed of either wood or metal and which are arranged parallel with each other at the center of the supporting-frame.  \n  When the stretcher-bars are constructed of wood, the fence-wires may be stapled to them, and when constructed of metal, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing, the ends of the fence-wire may be passed through suitable perforations of the stretcher-bars and be securedto the same in any suitable manner. 1  \n  The vertical stretcher-bars are connected by rods or bolts 8, which limit the outward movement of the same. The rods or bolts pass loosely through openings of the stretcher-bars and are arranged horizontally at the upper and lower ends thereof and are provided with suitable means for engaging the stretcher-bars. These means preferably consist of heads 9 and nuts 10. The nuts are arranged on threaded portions of the rods or bolts and are capable of adjustment After the wires have been placed under a uniform tension by any suitable means they are stretched to the desired tension by means of the levers 3, which are fulcrumed on the posts suitable pivots. The levers, which extend outwardly and upwardly from the posts oruprights, are provided at their outer ends with weights 12, which. may be of any desired size and character. The levers are rovided at their inner ends with angularlyisposed up-\u0026#39; wardly-extending arms 13, which are supported bybraces 14 and which are connected by substantially V-shaped wires 15 with the stretcher-bars. The V-shaped wires, which diverge from the arms 13 of the levers, are connected with the same by suitable links 16, and they cross each other between the stretcher-bars. The ends 17 of the wires 15 are secured to the stretcher-bars preferably by being passed through or around the same and twisted, as shown; but any other suitable means may be employed for this purpose. Each lever is connected with the stretcherbar at the opposite side of the device, so that the weights will operate to draw the stretcherbars toward each other, and thereby simultaneously stretch all the wires of the fence, and by varying the size of the weights the fence-wires may be held at any desired tension, and they will be automatically maintained thereat. The levers will also permit maintain the wires taut and at the same time prevent them from breaking. The ivots 11 of the levers are supported by suitab e braces 18, consisting of bars or straps secured to the posts or uprights beneath the pivots 11.  \n Having thus fully described my invention,  \n What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. A wire-stretcher, comprising a support designed to be located between the ends of a fence, stretcher-bars adapted to be connected with the fence-Wires, and opposite levers fulcrumed on the support and connected with the stretcher-bars.  \n  2. A wire-stretcher, comprising a support designed to be located between the ends of a fence, stretcher-bars spaced apart and adapted to have the fence-wires attached tothem, means for limiting the outward movement of the stretcher-bars, said means permitting a free inward movement of the said bars, and levers fulcrumed on the support and connected with the stretcher-bars.  \n  3. A Wire-stretcher, comprising a support designed to be located between the ends of a fence, spaced stretcher-bars adapted to be connected with the fence-wires, rods loosely connecting the stretcher-bars and provided with means for limiting the outward movement of the same, and levers connected with the stretcher-bars.  \n  4. A wirestretcher, comprising a support designed to be located between the ends of a fence, spaced stretcher-bars adapted to be connected with the fence-wires and located at opposite sides of the center of the support,  \n  weighted levers mounted on the support at .opposite sides of the stretcher bars, and  \n means for connecting each lever with the stretcher-bars at the opposite side of the suport. p 5. A wire-stretcher, comprising a support provided with opposite uprights and rovided with bracing means, vertical stretc erbars located between the uprights, Weighted levers fulcrumed on the uprights, and sub stantially V-shaped connecting means eX- tending from the levers to the stretcher-bars and connecting each lever with the stretcherbars at the opposite side of the support.  \n  6. A Wire-stretcher, comprising, opposite uprights, vertical stretcher-bars located between the uprights, weighted levers fulcrumed on the uprights and having angularly-disposed arms, V-shaped wires connecting the arms of the levers with the stretcherbars, and means for loosely connecting the stretcher-bars for limiting their outward movement.  \n  7.

LEWIS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Lompoc, in the county of Santa Barbara and State of California, have invented a new and useful Wire-Stretcher, of which the following is a specification. y \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The invention relates to improvements in wire-stretchers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The object of the present invention is to improve the construction of wire-stretchers and to provide asimple and comparatively inexpensive device of great strength and durability capable of simultaneously stretching all ofthe wires of a fence and of automatically maintaining the wires at a uniform tension and of permitting the'same to expand and contract under the varying conditions of the atmosphere and the changes in the temperature without breaking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e With these and other objects in view the invention consists in the construction and novel combination and arrangement of parts hereinafter fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawing, and pointed out in the claims hereto appended, it being understood that various changes in the form, pro \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eportion, size, and minor details of construcinvention. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The figure of the drawing is an elevation of a portion of a fence provided with a wirestretcher constructed in accordance with this invention. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring to the drawing, 1 1 designate posts or uprights spaced apart and connected near their upper ends by a horizontal top bar 2, which is interposed between the posts or uprights and which prevents the same from being drawn inward toward each other. The posts or uprights, which constitute a supporting-frame for levers 3, are braced by oppositely-disposed diagonally-arranged wires 4, crossing each other at or near the center of the supporting-frame and secured at their upper ends to the posts or uprights by staples or any other suitable means and connected at their lower ends to suitable anchors 5, which may consist of a block of stone or other suitable material embedded in the ground. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The wire-stretcher is arranged at a point between the ends of a fence, and the adjacent ends 6 of the fence-wires are connected to vertical stretcher-bars 7, which may be constructed of either wood or metal and which are arranged parallel with each other at the center of the supporting-frame. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e When the stretcher-bars are constructed of wood, the fence-wires may be stapled to them, and when constructed of metal, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing, the ends of the fence-wire may be passed through suitable perforations of the stretcher-bars and be securedto the same in any suitable manner. 1 \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The vertical stretcher-bars are connected by rods or bolts 8, which limit the outward movement of the same. The rods or bolts pass loosely through openings of the stretcher-bars and are arranged horizontally at the upper and lower ends thereof and are provided with suitable means for engaging the stretcher-bars. These means preferably consist of heads 9 and nuts 10. The nuts are arranged on threaded portions of the rods or bolts and are capable of adjustment After the wires have been placed under a uniform tension by any suitable means they are stretched to the desired tension by means of the levers 3, which are fulcrumed on the posts suitable pivots. The levers, which extend outwardly and upwardly from the posts oruprights, are provided at their outer ends with weights 12, which. may be of any desired size and character. The levers are rovided at their inner ends with angularlyisposed up-' wardly-extending arms 13, which are supported bybraces 14 and which are connected by substantially V-shaped wires 15 with the stretcher-bars. The V-shaped wires, which diverge from the arms 13 of the levers, are connected with the same by suitable links 16, and they cross each other between the stretcher-bars. The ends 17 of the wires 15 are secured to the stretcher-bars preferably by being passed through or around the same and twisted, as shown; but any other suitable means may be employed for this purpose. Each lever is connected with the stretcherbar at the opposite side of the device, so that the weights will operate to draw the stretcherbars toward each other, and thereby simultaneously stretch all the wires of the fence, and by varying the size of the weights the fence-wires may be held at any desired tension, and they will be automatically maintained thereat. The levers will also permit maintain the wires taut and at the same time prevent them from breaking. The ivots 11 of the levers are supported by suitab e braces 18, consisting of bars or straps secured to the posts or uprights beneath the pivots 11. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving thus fully described my invention, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

GIBBS, OF ZANESVILLE, OHIO.  \n Specification of Letters Patent.  \n Patented Dec. 12, 1905.  \n Application filed March 27, 1905. Serial No. 252A34.  \n To all whom it may concern;  \n  Be it known that I, WALTER A. GIBBS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Zanesville, in the county of Muskingum and State of Ohio, have invented or discovered .certain new and useful Improvements in Machines for Separating Tickets, 850., of which improvements the following is a specification.  \n  he invention described herein relates to certain improvements in apparatus for counting street-car tickets, coupons, \u0026amp;c., or other like articles, and has for its object a construction whereby such tickets, \u0026amp;c., are removed rapidly one by one from a pile or mass of the same, transferred to another suitable mechanism preferably constructed for mutilating the tickets, and by their passage through such mechanism a recording device is operated through the conjoint action of such mechanism and the ticket, 860.  \n  The invention is hereinafter more fully described and claimed.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this specification, Figure 1 is a perspective view of my improved ticket-counting mechanism. Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the same. Fig. 3 is a top plan view with the feed-bed removed, and Fig. 4 is a sectional elevation on a plane indicated by the line IV IV, Fig. 2.  \n  In the practice of my invention a bundle or stack of tickets are arranged between suitable guides 1 on a plate or table 2 and are gradually pushed forward by a moving head 3 toward and against a revolving pin 4. A suitable means for operating the head 3 consists of a threaded shaft 5, driven by any suitable meansas, for example, the wormgears 6 and 7, operated from the drivingshaft 8. Connection between the shaft and the head 3 is preferably formed by a threaded block 9, carried by a pin 10, vertically movable through the head and adapted to be locked in position in and out of engagement with the screw by a key 11 engaging grooves in the pin, as shown in Fig. 4. The separating-pin 4 is connected to a revolving shaft 12, preferably driven at a high speed by a suitable motoras, for example, an electric motor connected by a belt to the pulley 13 on said shaft. The pin is preferably connected to the shaft by a suitable clutch, so that it may be removed for renewal or repair. On this pin is formed a thread preferably having a pitch not greater than the thickness of the ticket or other article to be counted. The  \n \u0026#39; both of the rolls.  \n thread terminates abruptly and forms at the end of the pin a radial cutting edge, so that a ticket or other article will not be perforated and. drawn onto the screw by the action of the latter, but requires for the perforation of the ticket and its engagement by the screw the conjoint action of the revolving pin and the pressure of the moving head 3. In practice the feed movement of the block and the rotation of the pin 4 are so regulated with reference one to the other that while the head is moving forward a distance equal to the thickness of a ticket or other article the screw will have rotated several times, preferably about fifteen or twenty, so that from the time one ticket is perforated to the time the next ticket is perforated the first perforated ticket will have advanced the distance fifteen or twenty threads along the screw and be separated by such distance from others in the pack.  \n  A suitable means is employed for tearing the ticket from the screw or pin, thereby 1nutilating the same, and also for recording the fact that a ticket has been taken from the pack and mutilated. This recording mechanism is preferably so constructed as to necessitate the presence of the ticket in order to operate the recording mechanism.  \n  In the construction shown I employ two rolls 14 and 15, arranged in such relation to the screw that the ticket will after advancing a certain distance along the screw be turned down by the action of the screw or pin\u0026#39;in between the rollers, so as to be caught by the latter. As shown, these rolls are arranged at right angles, or approximatelyso, to the pin 4 and with their bite in a plane cutting the screw adjacent to its rear end or adjacent to the clutch 14. The screw is rotated so as to throw the corner of the ticket in between the rolls when the ticket shall have advanced sufiiciently far to clear a supporting-ledge 16, arranged to prevent the rotation of the ticket with the screw during a certain traverse thereof along the screw. By the operation of these rolls the ticket is torn off of the pin or screw, and thereby mutilated. In order to count the tickets, a finger 17 projects down through a pass formed by grooving one or The finger is made of such transverse dimensions as regards the grooves or pass that when no ticket is passing between the rolls the latter will not exert any pull whatsoever on the finger, which, as shown, is arranged in the path of the portion of the ticket moving along the supportingledge 16. As the ticket is drawn in between the rolls it is caused to pass between one edge of this finger and one of the rolls, thereby causing said rolls, one directly and the other through the medium of the ticket, to take a frictional grip on the finger and pull it down against the tension of the spring 18. As soon as the ticket has passed beyond the rolls the spring Will restore the finger to normal position. This finger is connected, as shown, to the operating-arm of any suitable counting mechanism, as indicated at 20. It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the counting mechanism can be operated only when a ticket is passing be tween the rollers, so that the latter will take a grip upon the actuating-finger.  \n  While \u0026#39;not necessary, it is preferred to operate the screw 5 for shifting the head 3 and the rollers from the shaft 12, to which the separating-screw is attached.  \n  It is characteristic of my improvement that each ticket is engaged by the separating device at a point inside of its periphery, shifted along from remaining tickets, and then removed from the separating device, its removal involving the operation of a counter. As the tickets are advanced to be caught by the separating device a distance equal to their thickness during a certain predetermined separating movement of such device, and as such separating device is not operative to engage a ticket except through the conjoint action of the pressing-head therewith, it is obvious that only one ticket or other ar ticle can be removed at a time.  \n  The separating device can be operated at a very high speed by the employment of a suitable motor, and the movement of the pressing-head can be correspondingly quick; but its advance should be slower than the movement of the ticket by the separating device.  \n I claim herein as my invention 1. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination means for removing a ticket from others in a pack or pile and means for registering such shifting of the ticket operative by the ticket after its removal from the pack or pile.  \n  2. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination means for engaging a ticket or other article, means for moving such ticket away from others of the pack or pile and a counter operative by the ticket after removal from the pack or pile.  \n 3. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c.,  \n having in combination means for engaging a ticket or other article, means for moving the ticket away from others in the pile or pack, and means for mutilating the ticket.  \n  4. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination means for engaging a ticket, means for moving the ticket away from others in the pile or pack, means for mutilating the ticket and a counter operative by the ticket.  \n  5.

A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination a revolving pin, means for forcing a ticket onto the pin, and means for moving the ticket along the pin a rate higher than its movement onto the pin.  \n  7. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination a revolving pin, means for forcing a ticket onto the pin, means for moving the ticket along the pin, and means for pulling the ticket off of the pin.  \n  8. A machine for separating tickets, 850., having in combination a revolving pin, means for forcing a ticket onto the pin, means for moving the ticket along the pin, and a pair of rollers for pulling the ticket from the pin.  \n  9. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination a revolving pin, means for forcing a ticket onto the pin, and a pair of rollers arranged in such relation to the pin that the ticket is shifted by the pin into the bite of the rolls.  \n  10. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination means for removing tickets one at a time from a pack or pile, a pair of rollers, a rod extending loosely between the rolls and a counter operative by said rod.  \n  11. A machine for separating tickets, \u0026amp;c., having in combination a revolving screw, means for forcing a ticket onto the screw, a pair of rollers arranged to pull a ticket from the screw and provided with a pass or opening between them, a rod extending loosely through the pass or opening and a counter operative by said rod.  \n  In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand.  \n WALTER A.

As the tickets are advanced to be caught by the separating device a distance equal to their thickness during a certain predetermined separating movement of such device, and as such separating device is not operative to engage a ticket except through the conjoint action of the pressing-head therewith, it is obvious that only one ticket or other ar ticle can be removed at a time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The separating device can be operated at a very high speed by the employment of a suitable motor, and the movement of the pressing-head can be correspondingly quick; but its advance should be slower than the movement of the ticket by the separating device. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI claim herein as my invention 1.

A  \n GIDEON GLENN WILLIAMS, OF SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA, ASSIGNOR, BY  \n DIRECT AND MESNE ASSIGNMENTS, TO THE WILLIAMS WEBB COM- PANY, OF SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA, A CORPORATION OF LOUISIANA.  \n AUTOMATIC FEED MECHANISM FOR PRlNTlNG-PRESSES.  \n Specification of Letters Patent.  \n Patented Dec. 19, 1905.  \n Application filed January 14, 1905. Serial No. 240,993.  \n To all whom it inning/concern:  \n  Be it known that I, GIDEON GLENN WIL- LIAMS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Shreveport, in the parish of Oaddo and State of Louisiana, have made certain new and useful Improvements in Automatic Feed Mechanism for Printing-Presses, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention relates tofeed mechanism for printing-presses; and it consists, substantially, in the improvements hereinafter particularly described, and pointed out in the claims.  \n One of the principal objects of the invention is to provide means whereby the feeding of aprinting-press of the ordinary platen-andbed type may be effected automatically instead of by hand, as heretofore, thereby dis pensing with the services of an attendant upon the press and enabling the press to be driven or operated by steam or other motive power.  \n  A further object is to provide means whereby a printing-press of the ordinary hand-fed platen-and-bed type may be readily converted into an automatically-fed press without removing or disconnecting any of the parts of the press or in any manner preventing reconversion of the press into its first or original form whenever desired.  \n  The above and additional objects are attained by means substantially such as are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of an automatic feed mechanism for printing-presses embodying my improvements. Fig. 2 is a plan view of the improvements minus the movable platen of the press from which the parts of the feed mechanism are actuated and also showing the impression-receiving web as broken 013? nearthe roll of the same. Fig. 3 is an end elevation of the feed mechanism, the web being omitted. Fig. 4 is an enlarged sectional view taken through the reciprocatory gripper and transversely of the rock-shafts by which the same is carried. Fig. 5 is a similar view taken through the stationary gripper, the cutter or blade being shown broken ofi. Fig. 6 is a detail view, in enlarged perspective, showing one of the clamps for securing the stationary gripper in place. Fig. 7 is a similar view of the other clamp for securing the Fig. 8 is an enlarged perspective view representing more clearly the manner in which the riders of the stationary gripper are mounted on the hub of the cams or eccentrics for this gripper. Fig. 9 is an enlarged part-sectional view showing the traverse of the web around the guiderollers therefor.  \n . Before proceeding with a more detailed description it may be stated that in the accompanying drawings I have illustrated only so much of an ordinary platen-and-bed printingpress as isnecessary to an understanding of the construction and operation of the parts constituting my improved automatic feed mechanism, while in the particular form of the improvements\u0026#39;also illustrated therein a specially-constructed frame is employed both to support and guide the operative parts of the feed mechanism, as well as to furnish a convenient means for attaching the structure to a suitable part of the printing-press to which it is to be applied. Special means are also employed for guiding a continuous im pression-receiving web from a roll of the same to and before the make-ready on the platen of the press, and thence back again to a specially-constructed reciprocatory gripper, which takes hold of the web succeeding each printed impression made thereon and draws portions thereof past the platen and outwardly to an extent corresponding to the extent of outward throw to which said reciprocatory gripper may previously have been adjusted. A specially-constructed stationary gripper is also employed to hold the web against movement at certain intervals pending the return movement of the reciprocatory gripper and.  \n the severance or separation of the printed portions of the web by means of a specially-constructed cutter employed for that purpose. The operative elements of the feed mechanism are adapted to be actuated from movable parts of the printing-press, and while I have herein represented my improvements in a certain preferred embodiment it will be understood, of course, that I am not to be limited to the precise details thereof in practice, since immaterial changes therein may be resorted to coming within the scope of my invention.  \n  Reference being bad to the drawings by the designating characters marked thereon, 1 represents the movable platen of an ordinary platen-and-bed printing-press, which may be provided with a make-read y (not shown) of any preferred character, but minus the usual pins from the platen for holding in position the card or sheet to receive the impression from the form on the bed (not shown) of the press. Secured to the back of the platen, at each lower corner thereof, is a bracket 2, and loosely mounted in said brackets are journals 3 from the upper corners of a hanging frame 4, having end pieces 5,\u0026#39;between the lower portions of which are supported the ends of a roller 6, the said frame being provided with a longitudinal groove at 7 and also with longitudinal slots at 8 and at the outer ,or rear side thereof with a weight 9, tending to always maintain v the frame in a vertical position, as and for the purpose hereinafter more fully explained. Fitting slidably within the said groove 7 are flanges 7, formed at the lower ends of duplicate members 10, standing before the platen, and stretched between the upper ends of said members is a cord 11, on which is hung or suspended a sheet 12, of cardboard or the like,  \n the purpose of which will be presently explained\u0026#39; Said members 10 are preferably secured in place by means of bolts 13 passing through openings in the lower ends thereof and extending through the slots 8 and provided with nuts 14 at the outer or rear side of the frame 4, (see dotted lines, Fig. 3,) another \u0026#39;roller 13 being supported in any suitable manner below the roller 6. (See Figs. 1 and 3.)  \n  Secured by one or more bolts 14 to each of the parallel brackets 15, ordinarily employed as supports for the usual feed-table (not shown) of a hand-fed platen-and-bed printing-press, is  \n \u0026#39; one of two lower parallel brackets 16 of an attached frame A, comprising also the parallel upright members 17, connected at their upper ends by a top piece 18 and from which extend outwardly with reference to the rear side of the platen 1 duplicate horizontal members 19, the outer end of each of which is rigidly joined with the outer end of the corresponding member 16 by means of a curved member 20, suitable additional curved members 21 being formed with the frame, the lower portion of each of which intersects with the lower portion of the corresponding curved member 20 in such manner as to form a crotch 22 for receiving and supporting an end of a shaft 23, on which 1s held in roll form an endless impression-receiving web 24, which is acted upon and fed Supported in brackets 30, adjustably securedat 31 to the inner sides of the parallel upright members 17 of the frame A, are the ends or journals of a roller 32, located in convenient proximity to the movable platen 1, and also supported in a suitable bearing-plate 33, secured at 34 to each of said members 17, is an end orjournal of another roller 35, the position of which is elevated with respect to the said roller 32. Still further supported by the members 17 of the frame A, in suitable bearings provided near the upper ends of the members, beneath the top piece 18, is a rockshaft 36, the ends or journals of which project beyond the outer sides of said members 17 and have rigidly held thereon at 37 the hubs 38 of duplicate two-armed angle-levers 39, the longer arms 40 of which extend downwardly and each of which is formed with a longitudinal slot 41. (See Fig. 1.) The shorter arm 42 of each of said angle-levers 39 extends substantially at right angles to the longer arm of the lever,and the two said shorter arms are formed with corresponding internally-threaded holes 43 to receive screws 44, passing through eyes 45 therefor at the upper ends of duplicate rods 46, having similar eyes 47 at their lower ends, which receive the ends of pintles 48, projecting from the vertical edges of the movable platen 1. The connections between the upper ends of the connecting-rods 46 and the shorter arms 42 of the angle-levers 39 are made sufiiciently rigid by properly adjusting the tighteningnuts 49, working on the projecting ends of the headed screws 44, and it will be understood that the hub of each of the angle-levers may be sufficiently tightened upon the corresponding projecting end or journal of the rock-shaft 36 by means of a washer 50 and a nut 51 or in any other preferred way.  \n  Adjustably connected to the longer arms 40 of the angle-levers are duplicate plates 52, having corresponding holes 53 therein, through opposite ones of which are passed screw-pins 54, which also extend through the slots 41 in the said longer arms of the anglelevers and are provided with cotter-pins 55, washers 56 and 57, and nuts 58 to secure the plates and lever-arms together. The free ends or extremities of the said plates 52 are connected to pins 59, projecting from the ends of flattened portions 60 of the lower part or member 61 of a reciprocatory gripper 62, receiving its motion from the platen 1 or any other movable part of the printing press through the instrumentality of the said anglelevers and connecting-rods 46, hereinbefore referred to, and to hold said free ends of the said connecting-plates 52 in place upon the pins 59 suitable washers 63 are carried upon said pins, while headed screws 64 are inserted in the ends of the pins. (See Fig. 4.) The reciprocatory gripper 62 is supported upon the upper surfaces of the horizontal members IIO 19 of the frame A, and the same is guided in its movements by means of the said flattened portions 60- thereof working back and forth in the slots or spaces 28, formed between the said horizontal members 19 of the frame and the upper parallel plates 27, supported thereby. Said reciprocatory gripper also comprises an upper independently-movable part or member 65, the ends of which terminate close to the inner faces of the said plates 27 and have inserted therein from the under side, and preferably near the ends, the upper threaded portions 66 of pins 67, which work through vertical openings 67 formed in the lower member 61- of the gripper, said pins each having a head 68 at its lower end and provided with a spiralspring 69, having its bearing between said head and the under side of said lower member 61. (See Fig. 4.) This gripper member 61 is provided on its under side,near the ends,with pairs of parallel riders 70, which are slidably mounted on duplicate rock-shafts 71, each of which has its bearings in brackets 72 and 73, secured to the inner sides of the upright members 17 and curved members 20, respectively, of the frame A, and each of said rock-shafts is formed for its length with a longitudinal groove 74 (see Fig.  \n . 4) and has slidably fitted thereon the hub 75 of a cam or eccentric 76, said hub being provided with a feather or spline working in said groove 74. Each of said hubs is located between the adjacent pair of riders from the member 61 of the reciprocatory gripper 62, and one of said rock-shafts 71 is provided with a pinion 77, the teeth of which areengaged by the teeth of a rack-bar 78, having vertical movement in guides 79 and 80 therefor, secured at 81 and 82 to the inner sides of branches 83 and 84 of one of the upright members 17 of the frame A. (See Figs. 1 and 3.) Rigidly secured to the, rock-shafts 71, near the said frame members 17, are pendent arms 85 and 86, while movably connected at 87 to the ends of said arms are the ends of a transversely-movable horizontal yoke 88, having connected thereto at 89 one end of a spring 90, the other end of which is connected to the adjacent member 19 of the frame A in any suitable way. The\u0026#39;lower end of the rack-bar 78 is provided with a laterally-projecting foot 92, carrying a roller 93, and said rack-bar is normally restingin adownward position, with the said roller 93 resting on a cam 94, mounted on the main shaft of the printing-press, and which also constitutes a driver for the usual connecting-rod 95, extending to the swinging frame (not shown) of the press, which carries the form-bed. (Also not shown.) For approxi mately one-half of its circumference this cam 94 is struck or formed at 96 on a perfect circle, while from about the point 97 thereof the cam is of gradually-increasing radii and terminates at its highest point in a shoulder 98. (See Fig. 1.) The parts being in the position indicated at Fig. 1, it is apparent that as the portion 96 of the circumference of the cam moves beneath the foot 92 and its roller no movement will be imparted to the rack-bar; but during the time the said circumferential portion of the cam is traveling in contact with the roller the reciprocatory gripper 62 is being carried outwardly through the instrumentality of the before-described adjustable connections between the same and the movable platen 1, as will be understood. By the time the said reciprocatory gripper has reached the limit of its outward movement the starting-point of the rise on the circumference of the cam will have been carried around to the roller 93, whereupon the rack-bar 78 will be carried upwardly, thereby rocking both the shafts 71 in the same direction, due to the connection therebetween formed by the beforementioned arms 85 and 86 and theyoke 88. As the shafts 71 are thus rocked by the upward movement of the rack-bar the said arms and yoke are carried to the right in Fig. 3, the spring being thereby distended or placed under tension and the operative portions of the cams or eccentrics 76 on the rock-shafts brought around to exert a lifting action on the pins 67 of the reciprocatory gripper by engaging with the heads of said pins, the  \n movable member 65 of this gripper being thereby lifted to release the latter from the impression-receiving web 24 and allowing the gripper toelfect its return movement entirely free of said web. The Web is paid out from\u0026#39;its roll on shaft 23 and is first carried in the direction of the platen 1 over the roller 32 and thence downwardly before the face of the platen and between the latter and the sheet of cardboard 12 and against the surface of the roller 6 of the hanging frame 4, and finally it is passed over and beneath the roller 13 and returned on itself and carried back and over the elevated roller 35, thence to the said reciprocatory gripper 62, substantially as shown and as will be clearly understood from the drawings. As the gripper 62 is reciprocated the pairs of riders 70 carried thereby alternately engage the opposite ends of the hubs of the cams or eccentrics 76, and thus the latter devices are caused to move back and forth on the rock-shafts 71 with said gripper.  \n  Cooperating with the reciprocatory gripper 62 is a stationary gripper 97, which (see Fig. 5) is substantially identical in construc, tion with said reciprocatory gripper,thelower member thereof being indicated at 98 and having flattened portions 99 at the ends which rest upon the upper surfaces of the members 19 of the frame A, in that they extend into the slots or spaces formed between said members 19 and the before-mentioned plates 27. The upper and movable member of this stationary gripper is shown at 100, the same having the threaded portions of screw-pins 101 inserted therein from the under side, said \u0026amp;  \n pins working through corresponding vertical openings 102 therefor in the lower member 98 of the gripper, and the screw-pins having heads 103 at their lower ends and being surrounded by spiral springs 104, having their bearings between said heads and the under side of said lower member 98. This lower member 98 is provided with pendent riders 105 near the ends, corresponding to the pairs of pendent riders from the lower member of the reciprocatory gripper, and said riders 105 fit at their lower ends in annular grooves 106 of the hubs 107 of cams or eccentrics 108, also mounted on the rock-shafts 71, theselatter cams or eccentrics having the operative portions thereof disposed or set in reverse direction to that in which the corresponding portions of the cams or eccentrics 76 are disposed or set (see Figs. 1 and 5) and said hubs 107 having feathers or splines 107 fitting in said grooves 74 of said rock-shafts 71. The adjustments of the reciprocatory gripper are made in accordance with the size of the form to be printed on the impression-receiving web, and with each of said adjustments the said stationary gripper 97 is also adjusted or set to occupy aposition at the limit of the outward movement of said reciprocatory gripper. After being passed between the members of the reciprocatory gripper the web is carried between the members of the stationary gripper in like manner, and each time a length or portion of the web is drawn outwardly by the reciprocatory gripper the said web is carried to a corresponding extent through the stationary gripper. Extending in the direction of the platen from the inner face of the lower member of the stationary gripper are a plurality of rods 109, which serve as guides for the reciprocatory gripper, said rods being received in corresponding grooves 110 therefor formed in the upper face of the lower member 61 of said last-named gripper. (See Fig. 4.)  \n  To secure the stationary gripper in its different positions of adjustment, any suitable means may be employed; but preferably at one end thereof I employ a clamp 111, Fig. 7, having a single jaw 112 and a pair of jaws 113, embracing the outer edge of the adjacent horizontal member 19 of the frame A, the said jaws 113 also embracing between them the sides of the adjacent flattened portion 99 .of the lower member 98 of said gripper, the parts all being secured together by means of a screw 11 1, working through the clamp and bearing against the under side of said frame former embracing the outer edge of the other member 19 of the frame A, said upper jaws 121 also embracing between them the adjacent flattened portion of the said gripper member and the lower jaw 120 having ascrew 122 working through the same from beneath and bearing against the under side of the said frame member 19. The jaws 121 project be- I yond the back 123 of jaw 120, and fitted between the same is a block 124:, that is supported by a pin 125, projecting from the said adjacent flat portion of the said lower member 98 of this gripper.  \n  ,Mounted on a pin 126, projecting from the outer face of the lower member 98 of the stationary gripper 97, is one end of a pivoted cutter or blade 127, which is normally held in a retracted position upwardly by means of a curved flat spring 128, having one end thereof secured at 129 to the said block 12%, while its other end is free and works beneath and exerts a constant pressure upwardly against a yoke 130, supported by the said cutter or blade, as shown. The free end of this cutter or blade is provided with an extension to which is fastened one end of a cord 131, which is thence passed over the pulleys 117 and 118 on block 116, the said cord having a spring 132 in its length and being finally carried to and secured upon a projection 133 from the pitman 95.  \n  In furnishing the foregoing description of the construction and organization of the parts of my improvements it has been endeavored also to explain the operation of said parts; but the following description may be added. According to the adjustments made of the described connections between the platen 1 and the reciprocatory gripper 62, the latter, as shown in Fig. 1, is at the limit of its movement inwardly or in the direction of the platen. the roller 93 of the foot 92 of the rack-bar 78 having just been carried over the shoulder or highest point 98 of the cam 94 and the upper member of said reciprocatory gripper having also just been lowered upon the lower member thereof by the moving of the operative portions of the cams or eccentrics 76 out of their engagement with the screw-pins 67, (it being understood that during the previous outward movement of the said reciprocatory gripper the upper member 100 of the stationary gripper had been maintained in an elevated position by means of the engagement of the operative portions of the cams or eccentrics 108 with the heads of the screw-pins 101.) Simultaneously with the lowering of the said upper member of the reciprocatory gripper by the action of the springs on the screw-pins 67 the upper member 100 of the stationary gripper 97 is elevated from the lower member 98 thereof by the action of the operative portions of cams or eccentrics 108 upon the heads of the screw-pins 101, so that it will now be seen that the reciprocatory gripper will be moved in the reverse-or outer direction, carrying with it a portion of the web, the latter being moved for a proportionate extent through the now open stationary of the stationary gripper is lowered by release of the operative portions of cams or eccentrics 108 with the heads of screw-pins 101, and then the reciprocatory gripper moves inwardly entirely free of the web, the latter being now held by the stationary gripper. At some time during the inward movement of the reciprocatory gripper the cord leading from the cutter or blade 127 will be acted on by the cam in such manner as to cause the cutter to descend and cut off a printed portion of the web, which falls upon a shelf 135 to receive it, and then by the time the reciprocatory gripper reaches the end of said inward movement thereof the shoulder or highest part of the cam-will again have been moved around beneath the roller of the foot of the rack-bar, whereupon by the reverse action of the different sets of cams or eccentrics referred to, caused ,by the descent of the rack-bar, which now takes place, the upper members of the stationary and reciprocatory grippers, respectively, will be simultaneously raised and lowered, and in this way is the operation of the feed mechanism carried out. As\u0026#39;hereinbefore stated, on the upward movement of the rack-bar 7 8 the shafts 71 are rocked in one direction, carrying with them the arms be rocked in the reverse direction, thereby assisting said rack-bar to descend, as and for the purpose previously explained. It may be further added that the spring-retracted cutter or blade is held to its work by means of a spring 136 exerting pressure thereagainst at the end at which the same is supported upon the pin from the stationary gripper.  \n  To adjust the stationary gripper in accordance with the adjustments of the outward throw of the reciprocatory gripper, it is simply necessary to loosen the clamps thereon at the ends, as is apparent. The weight 9 on the hanging frame tends to prevent said frame from being thrown from an approximately vertical position by the swinging movements of the platen, and the sheet, 12 of cardboard prevents indentations on the parts of the web adjacent to the platen when the parts thereof adjacent to the bed of the press are receivingimpressions from the type-form (not shown) on the bed.  \n  It will he noticed that the fixed gripper is located in rear of the movable gripper and between the same and the cutter, so that the free end of the web will be gripped and held taut by the stationary gripper during the return travel of the movable gripper.  \n  In some instances, though not necessarily, a partial envelop 137, of rough material, as emery-paper or the like, may be applied to the movable member of each of the grippers referred to by which to cause the member to take a firmer grip upon the impression-receiving web.  \n Having thus described my invention, What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is I 1.

Serial No. 240,993. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo all whom it inning/concern: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Be it known that I, GIDEON GLENN WIL- LIAMS, a citizen of the United States, residing at Shreveport, in the parish of Oaddo and State of Louisiana, have made certain new and useful Improvements in Automatic Feed Mechanism for Printing-Presses, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e This invention relates tofeed mechanism for printing-presses; and it consists, substantially, in the improvements hereinafter particularly described, and pointed out in the claims. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the principal objects of the invention is to provide means whereby the feeding of aprinting-press of the ordinary platen-andbed type may be effected automatically instead of by hand, as heretofore, thereby dis pensing with the services of an attendant upon the press and enabling the press to be driven or operated by steam or other motive power. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A further object is to provide means whereby a printing-press of the ordinary hand-fed platen-and-bed type may be readily converted into an automatically-fed press without removing or disconnecting any of the parts of the press or in any manner preventing reconversion of the press into its first or original form whenever desired. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The above and additional objects are attained by means substantially such as are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of an automatic feed mechanism for printing-presses embodying my improvements. Fig. 2 is a plan view of the improvements minus the movable platen of the press from which the parts of the feed mechanism are actuated and also showing the impression-receiving web as broken 013? nearthe roll of the same. Fig. 3 is an end elevation of the feed mechanism, the web being omitted. Fig. 4 is an enlarged sectional view taken through the reciprocatory gripper and transversely of the rock-shafts by which the same is carried. Fig. 5 is a similar view taken through the stationary gripper, the cutter or blade being shown broken ofi. Fig. 6 is a detail view, in enlarged perspective, showing one of the clamps for securing the stationary gripper in place. Fig. 7 is a similar view of the other clamp for securing the Fig. 8 is an enlarged perspective view representing more clearly the manner in which the riders of the stationary gripper are mounted on the hub of the cams or eccentrics for this gripper. Fig. 9 is an enlarged part-sectional view showing the traverse of the web around the guiderollers therefor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. Before proceeding with a more detailed description it may be stated that in the accompanying drawings I have illustrated only so much of an ordinary platen-and-bed printingpress as isnecessary to an understanding of the construction and operation of the parts constituting my improved automatic feed mechanism, while in the particular form of the improvements'also illustrated therein a specially-constructed frame is employed both to support and guide the operative parts of the feed mechanism, as well as to furnish a convenient means for attaching the structure to a suitable part of the printing-press to which it is to be applied. Special means are also employed for guiding a continuous im pression-receiving web from a roll of the same to and before the make-ready on the platen of the press, and thence back again to a specially-constructed reciprocatory gripper, which takes hold of the web succeeding each printed impression made thereon and draws portions thereof past the platen and outwardly to an extent corresponding to the extent of outward throw to which said reciprocatory gripper may previously have been adjusted. A specially-constructed stationary gripper is also employed to hold the web against movement at certain intervals pending the return movement of the reciprocatory gripper and. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe severance or separation of the printed portions of the web by means of a specially-constructed cutter employed for that purpose. The operative elements of the feed mechanism are adapted to be actuated from movable parts of the printing-press, and while I have herein represented my improvements in a certain preferred embodiment it will be understood, of course, that I am not to be limited to the precise details thereof in practice, since immaterial changes therein may be resorted to coming within the scope of my invention. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Reference being bad to the drawings by the designating characters marked thereon, 1 represents the movable platen of an ordinary platen-and-bed printing-press, which may be provided with a make-read y (not shown) of any preferred character, but minus the usual pins from the platen for holding in position the card or sheet to receive the impression from the form on the bed (not shown) of the press. Secured to the back of the platen, at each lower corner thereof, is a bracket 2, and loosely mounted in said brackets are journals 3 from the upper corners of a hanging frame 4, having end pieces 5,'between the lower portions of which are supported the ends of a roller 6, the said frame being provided with a longitudinal groove at 7 and also with longitudinal slots at 8 and at the outer ,or rear side thereof with a weight 9, tending to always maintain v the frame in a vertical position, as and for the purpose hereinafter more fully explained. Fitting slidably within the said groove 7 are flanges 7, formed at the lower ends of duplicate members 10, standing before the platen, and stretched between the upper ends of said members is a cord 11, on which is hung or suspended a sheet 12, of cardboard or the like, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe purpose of which will be presently explained' Said members 10 are preferably secured in place by means of bolts 13 passing through openings in the lower ends thereof and extending through the slots 8 and provided with nuts 14 at the outer or rear side of the frame 4, (see dotted lines, Fig. 3,) another 'roller 13 being supported in any suitable manner below the roller 6. (See Figs. 1 and 3.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Secured by one or more bolts 14 to each of the parallel brackets 15, ordinarily employed as supports for the usual feed-table (not shown) of a hand-fed platen-and-bed printing-press, is \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e' one of two lower parallel brackets 16 of an attached frame A, comprising also the parallel upright members 17, connected at their upper ends by a top piece 18 and from which extend outwardly with reference to the rear side of the platen 1 duplicate horizontal members 19, the outer end of each of which is rigidly joined with the outer end of the corresponding member 16 by means of a curved member 20, suitable additional curved members 21 being formed with the frame, the lower portion of each of which intersects with the lower portion of the corresponding curved member 20 in such manner as to form a crotch 22 for receiving and supporting an end of a shaft 23, on which 1s held in roll form an endless impression-receiving web 24, which is acted upon and fed Supported in brackets 30, adjustably securedat 31 to the inner sides of the parallel upright members 17 of the frame A, are the ends or journals of a roller 32, located in convenient proximity to the movable platen 1, and also supported in a suitable bearing-plate 33, secured at 34 to each of said members 17, is an end orjournal of another roller 35, the position of which is elevated with respect to the said roller 32. Still further supported by the members 17 of the frame A, in suitable bearings provided near the upper ends of the members, beneath the top piece 18, is a rockshaft 36, the ends or journals of which project beyond the outer sides of said members 17 and have rigidly held thereon at 37 the hubs 38 of duplicate two-armed angle-levers 39, the longer arms 40 of which extend downwardly and each of which is formed with a longitudinal slot 41. (See Fig. 1.) The shorter arm 42 of each of said angle-levers 39 extends substantially at right angles to the longer arm of the lever,and the two said shorter arms are formed with corresponding internally-threaded holes 43 to receive screws 44, passing through eyes 45 therefor at the upper ends of duplicate rods 46, having similar eyes 47 at their lower ends, which receive the ends of pintles 48, projecting from the vertical edges of the movable platen 1. The connections between the upper ends of the connecting-rods 46 and the shorter arms 42 of the angle-levers 39 are made sufiiciently rigid by properly adjusting the tighteningnuts 49, working on the projecting ends of the headed screws 44, and it will be understood that the hub of each of the angle-levers may be sufficiently tightened upon the corresponding projecting end or journal of the rock-shaft 36 by means of a washer 50 and a nut 51 or in any other preferred way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Adjustably connected to the longer arms 40 of the angle-levers are duplicate plates 52, having corresponding holes 53 therein, through opposite ones of which are passed screw-pins 54, which also extend through the slots 41 in the said longer arms of the anglelevers and are provided with cotter-pins 55, washers 56 and 57, and nuts 58 to secure the plates and lever-arms together. The free ends or extremities of the said plates 52 are connected to pins 59, projecting from the ends of flattened portions 60 of the lower part or member 61 of a reciprocatory gripper 62, receiving its motion from the platen 1 or any other movable part of the printing press through the instrumentality of the said anglelevers and connecting-rods 46, hereinbefore referred to, and to hold said free ends of the said connecting-plates 52 in place upon the pins 59 suitable washers 63 are carried upon said pins, while headed screws 64 are inserted in the ends of the pins. (See Fig. 4.) The reciprocatory gripper 62 is supported upon the upper surfaces of the horizontal members IIO 19 of the frame A, and the same is guided in its movements by means of the said flattened portions 60- thereof working back and forth in the slots or spaces 28, formed between the said horizontal members 19 of the frame and the upper parallel plates 27, supported thereby. Said reciprocatory gripper also comprises an upper independently-movable part or member 65, the ends of which terminate close to the inner faces of the said plates 27 and have inserted therein from the under side, and preferably near the ends, the upper threaded portions 66 of pins 67, which work through vertical openings 67 formed in the lower member 61- of the gripper, said pins each having a head 68 at its lower end and provided with a spiralspring 69, having its bearing between said head and the under side of said lower member 61. (See Fig. 4.) This gripper member 61 is provided on its under side,near the ends,with pairs of parallel riders 70, which are slidably mounted on duplicate rock-shafts 71, each of which has its bearings in brackets 72 and 73, secured to the inner sides of the upright members 17 and curved members 20, respectively, of the frame A, and each of said rock-shafts is formed for its length with a longitudinal groove 74 (see Fig. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. 4) and has slidably fitted thereon the hub 75 of a cam or eccentric 76, said hub being provided with a feather or spline working in said groove 74. Each of said hubs is located between the adjacent pair of riders from the member 61 of the reciprocatory gripper 62, and one of said rock-shafts 71 is provided with a pinion 77, the teeth of which areengaged by the teeth of a rack-bar 78, having vertical movement in guides 79 and 80 therefor, secured at 81 and 82 to the inner sides of branches 83 and 84 of one of the upright members 17 of the frame A. (See Figs. 1 and 3.) Rigidly secured to the, rock-shafts 71, near the said frame members 17, are pendent arms 85 and 86, while movably connected at 87 to the ends of said arms are the ends of a transversely-movable horizontal yoke 88, having connected thereto at 89 one end of a spring 90, the other end of which is connected to the adjacent member 19 of the frame A in any suitable way. The'lower end of the rack-bar 78 is provided with a laterally-projecting foot 92, carrying a roller 93, and said rack-bar is normally restingin adownward position, with the said roller 93 resting on a cam 94, mounted on the main shaft of the printing-press, and which also constitutes a driver for the usual connecting-rod 95, extending to the swinging frame (not shown) of the press, which carries the form-bed. (Also not shown.) For approxi mately one-half of its circumference this cam 94 is struck or formed at 96 on a perfect circle, while from about the point 97 thereof the cam is of gradually-increasing radii and terminates at its highest point in a shoulder 98. (See Fig. 1.) The parts being in the position indicated at Fig. 1, it is apparent that as the portion 96 of the circumference of the cam moves beneath the foot 92 and its roller no movement will be imparted to the rack-bar; but during the time the said circumferential portion of the cam is traveling in contact with the roller the reciprocatory gripper 62 is being carried outwardly through the instrumentality of the before-described adjustable connections between the same and the movable platen 1, as will be understood. By the time the said reciprocatory gripper has reached the limit of its outward movement the starting-point of the rise on the circumference of the cam will have been carried around to the roller 93, whereupon the rack-bar 78 will be carried upwardly, thereby rocking both the shafts 71 in the same direction, due to the connection therebetween formed by the beforementioned arms 85 and 86 and theyoke 88. As the shafts 71 are thus rocked by the upward movement of the rack-bar the said arms and yoke are carried to the right in Fig. 3, the spring being thereby distended or placed under tension and the operative portions of the cams or eccentrics 76 on the rock-shafts brought around to exert a lifting action on the pins 67 of the reciprocatory gripper by engaging with the heads of said pins, the \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emovable member 65 of this gripper being thereby lifted to release the latter from the impression-receiving web 24 and allowing the gripper toelfect its return movement entirely free of said web. The Web is paid out from'its roll on shaft 23 and is first carried in the direction of the platen 1 over the roller 32 and thence downwardly before the face of the platen and between the latter and the sheet of cardboard 12 and against the surface of the roller 6 of the hanging frame 4, and finally it is passed over and beneath the roller 13 and returned on itself and carried back and over the elevated roller 35, thence to the said reciprocatory gripper 62, substantially as shown and as will be clearly understood from the drawings. As the gripper 62 is reciprocated the pairs of riders 70 carried thereby alternately engage the opposite ends of the hubs of the cams or eccentrics 76, and thus the latter devices are caused to move back and forth on the rock-shafts 71 with said gripper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Cooperating with the reciprocatory gripper 62 is a stationary gripper 97, which (see Fig. 5) is substantially identical in construc, tion with said reciprocatory gripper,thelower member thereof being indicated at 98 and having flattened portions 99 at the ends which rest upon the upper surfaces of the members 19 of the frame A, in that they extend into the slots or spaces formed between said members 19 and the before-mentioned plates 27. The upper and movable member of this stationary gripper is shown at 100, the same having the threaded portions of screw-pins 101 inserted therein from the under side, said \u0026amp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epins working through corresponding vertical openings 102 therefor in the lower member 98 of the gripper, and the screw-pins having heads 103 at their lower ends and being surrounded by spiral springs 104, having their bearings between said heads and the under side of said lower member 98. This lower member 98 is provided with pendent riders 105 near the ends, corresponding to the pairs of pendent riders from the lower member of the reciprocatory gripper, and said riders 105 fit at their lower ends in annular grooves 106 of the hubs 107 of cams or eccentrics 108, also mounted on the rock-shafts 71, theselatter cams or eccentrics having the operative portions thereof disposed or set in reverse direction to that in which the corresponding portions of the cams or eccentrics 76 are disposed or set (see Figs. 1 and 5) and said hubs 107 having feathers or splines 107 fitting in said grooves 74 of said rock-shafts 71. The adjustments of the reciprocatory gripper are made in accordance with the size of the form to be printed on the impression-receiving web, and with each of said adjustments the said stationary gripper 97 is also adjusted or set to occupy aposition at the limit of the outward movement of said reciprocatory gripper. After being passed between the members of the reciprocatory gripper the web is carried between the members of the stationary gripper in like manner, and each time a length or portion of the web is drawn outwardly by the reciprocatory gripper the said web is carried to a corresponding extent through the stationary gripper. Extending in the direction of the platen from the inner face of the lower member of the stationary gripper are a plurality of rods 109, which serve as guides for the reciprocatory gripper, said rods being received in corresponding grooves 110 therefor formed in the upper face of the lower member 61 of said last-named gripper. (See Fig. 4.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To secure the stationary gripper in its different positions of adjustment, any suitable means may be employed; but preferably at one end thereof I employ a clamp 111, Fig. 7, having a single jaw 112 and a pair of jaws 113, embracing the outer edge of the adjacent horizontal member 19 of the frame A, the said jaws 113 also embracing between them the sides of the adjacent flattened portion 99 .of the lower member 98 of said gripper, the parts all being secured together by means of a screw 11 1, working through the clamp and bearing against the under side of said frame former embracing the outer edge of the other member 19 of the frame A, said upper jaws 121 also embracing between them the adjacent flattened portion of the said gripper member and the lower jaw 120 having ascrew 122 working through the same from beneath and bearing against the under side of the said frame member 19. The jaws 121 project be- I yond the back 123 of jaw 120, and fitted between the same is a block 124:, that is supported by a pin 125, projecting from the said adjacent flat portion of the said lower member 98 of this gripper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e ,Mounted on a pin 126, projecting from the outer face of the lower member 98 of the stationary gripper 97, is one end of a pivoted cutter or blade 127, which is normally held in a retracted position upwardly by means of a curved flat spring 128, having one end thereof secured at 129 to the said block 12%, while its other end is free and works beneath and exerts a constant pressure upwardly against a yoke 130, supported by the said cutter or blade, as shown. The free end of this cutter or blade is provided with an extension to which is fastened one end of a cord 131, which is thence passed over the pulleys 117 and 118 on block 116, the said cord having a spring 132 in its length and being finally carried to and secured upon a projection 133 from the pitman 95. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In furnishing the foregoing description of the construction and organization of the parts of my improvements it has been endeavored also to explain the operation of said parts; but the following description may be added. According to the adjustments made of the described connections between the platen 1 and the reciprocatory gripper 62, the latter, as shown in Fig. 1, is at the limit of its movement inwardly or in the direction of the platen. the roller 93 of the foot 92 of the rack-bar 78 having just been carried over the shoulder or highest point 98 of the cam 94 and the upper member of said reciprocatory gripper having also just been lowered upon the lower member thereof by the moving of the operative portions of the cams or eccentrics 76 out of their engagement with the screw-pins 67, (it being understood that during the previous outward movement of the said reciprocatory gripper the upper member 100 of the stationary gripper had been maintained in an elevated position by means of the engagement of the operative portions of the cams or eccentrics 108 with the heads of the screw-pins 101.) Simultaneously with the lowering of the said upper member of the reciprocatory gripper by the action of the springs on the screw-pins 67 the upper member 100 of the stationary gripper 97 is elevated from the lower member 98 thereof by the action of the operative portions of cams or eccentrics 108 upon the heads of the screw-pins 101, so that it will now be seen that the reciprocatory gripper will be moved in the reverse-or outer direction, carrying with it a portion of the web, the latter being moved for a proportionate extent through the now open stationary of the stationary gripper is lowered by release of the operative portions of cams or eccentrics 108 with the heads of screw-pins 101, and then the reciprocatory gripper moves inwardly entirely free of the web, the latter being now held by the stationary gripper. At some time during the inward movement of the reciprocatory gripper the cord leading from the cutter or blade 127 will be acted on by the cam in such manner as to cause the cutter to descend and cut off a printed portion of the web, which falls upon a shelf 135 to receive it, and then by the time the reciprocatory gripper reaches the end of said inward movement thereof the shoulder or highest part of the cam-will again have been moved around beneath the roller of the foot of the rack-bar, whereupon by the reverse action of the different sets of cams or eccentrics referred to, caused ,by the descent of the rack-bar, which now takes place, the upper members of the stationary and reciprocatory grippers, respectively, will be simultaneously raised and lowered, and in this way is the operation of the feed mechanism carried out. As'hereinbefore stated, on the upward movement of the rack-bar 7 8 the shafts 71 are rocked in one direction, carrying with them the arms be rocked in the reverse direction, thereby assisting said rack-bar to descend, as and for the purpose previously explained. It may be further added that the spring-retracted cutter or blade is held to its work by means of a spring 136 exerting pressure thereagainst at the end at which the same is supported upon the pin from the stationary gripper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e To adjust the stationary gripper in accordance with the adjustments of the outward throw of the reciprocatory gripper, it is simply necessary to loosen the clamps thereon at the ends, as is apparent. The weight 9 on the hanging frame tends to prevent said frame from being thrown from an approximately vertical position by the swinging movements of the platen, and the sheet, 12 of cardboard prevents indentations on the parts of the web adjacent to the platen when the parts thereof adjacent to the bed of the press are receivingimpressions from the type-form (not shown) on the bed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will he noticed that the fixed gripper is located in rear of the movable gripper and between the same and the cutter, so that the free end of the web will be gripped and held taut by the stationary gripper during the return travel of the movable gripper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In some instances, though not necessarily, a partial envelop 137, of rough material, as emery-paper or the like, may be applied to the movable member of each of the grippers referred to by which to cause the member to take a firmer grip upon the impression-receiving web. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving thus described my invention, What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is I 1.

Serial No. 257,243.  \n To a w/wnt it nuty concern:  \n  Be it known that I, CAESAR R. SPLIVALO, a citizen of the United States, residing in the city and county of San Francisco, State of California, have invented new and useful Im provements in Paste-Presses, of which the following is a specification.  \n  My invention relates to improvements in presses used in the preparation of macaroni and like paste products.  \n  It is customary in the present state of the art to employ a steam-jacketed cylinder, into which the paste in bulk is delivered and by power to force the paste through suitable dies in the bottom of the cylinder to form tubes, strings, or strips, which on being dried form the macaroni ,vermicclli, and other dried paste products of commerce. The press-cylinder being round, the heat of the steam in the surrounding jacket penetrates inwardly on all sides to heat the paste to give it its required degree of plasticity and mobility; but as the penetrating power of the heat is limited generally to about four inches in any one direction the capacity of these round presses is reduced accordingly. I/Vhere it is attempted, as it sometimes is, to make the press-cylinder much over eight inches in diameter, the interior portions of the paste are found to be more or less unaffected by the heat, resulting in an inferior product. Moreover, the steam in these cylindrical presses acting unequally on the body of paste causes parts of it to flow out through the dies more rapidly than other portions, thereby producing tubes of different length. The operator from time to time cuts off a bundle of these exuded paste tubes, which are by subsequent handling rearranged in rows in single layers on the drying-trays.  \n  My invention comprehends the constructing of a press-box with a bore which in crosssection shall have a major axis of indefinite length and a minor axis of a length not to exceed the distance to which steam may penetrate from opposite sides of the press-box. In other words, I may have a press-box oval or oblong in cross-section, and the major axis or space between the ends of the oval or oblong may be from two to six feet or more, while the minor axis or the space between the side walls of the box will not exceed, say, eight inches where the effective penetrating power of the steam from either side does not exceed four inches. The result of this 0011- struction is the more thorough and equable heating of all the contained paste to cause it to How through the dies evenly and also the production of a machine of greatly-increased capacity over those now employed. Furthermore, by providing a die corresponding in shape to the bottom of the press-box and having suitably-staggered perforations and by arranging suitable spreading and cutting mechanism underneath the cylinder I am able to take the tubes as they come from the die, spread them directly onto the trays or onto sheets of paper to be slid onto the trays ready for drying Without the expense and loss of time of a second or third handling.  \n  Having reference to the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a vertical section taken longitudinally through my apparatus on line X X, Fig. 2. Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the same. Fig. 3 is an end elevation of the spreading and -cutting mechanism. Fig. 4 is a plan of a die. Fig. 5 is a section of the same.  \n  A represents my improved impression-cylinder or press-box, here shown as having a bore oblong in cross-section with a steamjacket 2 adjacent to its end and on its longer sides only. The space between the longer sides of the box is less than twice the efiective penetrating distance of the steam from the jacket on either side. Hence no end acket is necessary, thereby lessening the cost of construction, while the sides of the box may be prolonged to any suitable length within the power of the compression means. Preferably the box is made in two sections adapted to be assembled and bolted together by the bolts 3, as shown.  \n  4. is a plunger corresponding in shape and area to the bore of the box. It is carried by the piston-rod 5, operated by any suitable means, as the hydraulic cylinder 6. The latter is suitably mounted above and connected rigidly with the press-box by means of the tie-rods or columns 7. The plunger is ada ted to be retracted above the opening in t 1e ress to give sufficient clearance for the infeed of the paste.  \n  Power is applied in the usual fashion to reciprocate the plunger to express the contents of the press-box through the perforations in the die 8, which is suitably-supported in the bottom of the box. This die is of a construction common to (presses of this character and with any style or shape of may be provide from the die.  \n perforations desired. As here shown, the perforations are round. A central core 9 is rovided in each perforation, which forms the hollow of the paste-tube. The die is supported at its edges by an internal ledge in the bottom of the cylinder and rests on a central and longitudinally-extending braceplate or strongback 10, carried from the press by the stirrups 11. This strong-back 10 serves a double purpose: first, to support the die against the thrust of the plunger, and, secondly, to divide the exuded tubes into two parts and to form a support for the inclined boards 12, one of which boards directs part of the tubes to one side of the machine, and the other board directs the remaining tubes to the other side of the machine.  \n  The perforations in the die-plate are pref erably arranged and staggered, so that the tubes issuing therethrough will not stand directly one behind another, but will permit the two bundles to be laid out or spread substantially flat in single layers on the receiving surface or surfaces held beneath the die.  \n  The press is preferably mounted on an ele vated support to allow plenty of room for the roper handling of the tubes as they come As here shown, the tubes from either side of the machine are received onto corresponding inclined boards or deflectors 13 and pass beneath the respective knives 14 onto the hinged boards or shelves 15.  \n  The parts 12, 13, 14, and 15, with their cooperating mechanisms, are duplicated, so that it is understood that the description of the portion of the spreading and cutting device for the tubes issuing from one side of the die is the same for that on the other side of the machine. This spreading and cutting device may be mounted on a frame B, capable of being moved in under and out from beneath the cylinder at any time it is desired.  \n  The deflectors 13 are fixed permanently in the frame B, and the boards or shelves 15 are hinged or pivoted in the frame, as shown at 16, and extend up underneath the deflectors 13 and sufliciently out of contact therewith to permit one or more sheets of paper or a tray or other receiving medium to be laid on a hinged board or shelf 15 and pass up underneath a corresponding deflector 13, the tray or paper forming the medium on which the tubes as they hang in long strings from the press are received.  \n  In practice I generally arrange for a number of sheets of paper to be laid on each of the shelves 15, with the upper ends of the sheets passed up through the space between the lower edge of a deflecting-board 13 and its corresponding shelf 15 and secured by suitable means, as the pins or tacks 16, to the upper edge of the shelf. Knowing the number of trays of tubes that a single charge of the press will fill, I provide an appropriate number ofsheets of paper for each of the hinged shelves 15, since each sheet is intended to correspond to a tray. The knives 14 are supported in slots 17 in the ends of frame B and have a movement to and from their respective deflecting-boards 12 corresponding with the turning of the boards 15 about their pivots. a spring 18, operating normally to hold the knives away from the boards 12. The latter are each preferably cut away to provide a ledge 19, with which the cutting edge of a knife cooperates when moved in against the board to sever a bunch of tubes. The movement of the knives is so related to the movement of the respective hinged shelves 15 that when a bunch of tubes on one side or the other of the machine has gradually been forced out, so that it extends substantially to the bottom of a shelf 15, the latter may be turned on its hinges into a position indicated in dotted lines, Fig. 1, whereupon the corresponding knife 14 will be actuated to sever this particular bunch of tubes, leaving them supported entirely on the shelf 15 or upon a sheet of paper upon the shelf. The severance however, of the bunch preferably does not take place until the shelf has assumed such a flat angle that the tubes will not slide off when the knife comes down. VVith either of the shelves in the position as indicated in dotted lines, Fig. 1, its incumbent load can be slid onto a tray 20, supported on the table Each end of each knife is connected to 21, by simply taking hold of the topmost 15 is here shown as follows: Relative to each knife and shelf and at each end of a knife and outside of frame B is a bar 22, having a slot 23 at one end, in which the bar is pivoted, as at 24, to permit of a limited reciprocating movement of the bar, as well as a pivotal movement of the same. The bars 22 are notched, as at 25, and are each connected by a strap 26 or equivalent flexible connection with the adjacent end of a knife. The straps pass over rollers 27, so as to bring a direct pull on a knife when any two bars which are connected to the knife are pulled down by the engagement of the prongs 28 on the lateral projections 29 on a corresponding shelf 15. These projections 29 are here shown comprising the ends of a cross-bar attached to a shelf and. extending through and workto cause that knife to be actuated to sever the bunch of tubeson that side of the machine at the proper moment.  \n  As previously stated, it is desired that the severance of the bunch of tubes will not take place until the shelf has been lifted into about the position indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 1. As soon as the tubes are severed there is no need of the knife remaining longer, so I provide a means by which the knife is released before the shelf has completed its up ward movement.  \n  As here shown, screws 31 are carried by the bars and engage the end of a projection 29 on a shelf at the proper moment to push the bars away from the projections 29 and release them from the prongs 28. Some adjustable means, as the screws 31, are desirable, so as to enable the two bars which are connected with a knife to be released simultaneously and cause both ends of the knife to be retracted at the same time. Thus it will be seen that a knife is operated and released by a simple upward movement of a shelf, and the operation of the knife being quite rapid the continued downward feed of the tubes from the die is not interfered with. As a matter of fact the tubes feed out very slowly, and it takes from fifty to sixty minutes to run a charge of paste through the press. By this construction of pressbox, spreading, and cutting mechanism one operator is able to handle the entire output of the machine, spread it and deliver it into a tray for drying.  \n  In order to equably heat the steam-jacket or portions of the steam-jacket, I prefer to have the steam-pipe 32 provided with a plurality of inlets 33, each controlled by a separate valve 34. As these inlets enter at different places in the length of the jacket, it is possible to regulate the heat for all portions of the paste, so that all the tubes will be of uniform quality and will flow at a uniform rate of speed.  \n  If it is found that any portion of the tubes does not flow as it should, the cocks 34, controlling the part of the cylinder from which these particular tubes are coming, may be turned on or off to either heat up or cool that part of the paste, as may be needed. Drain from the steam jacket may take place through the pipe In operating the press the full pressure of steam is not put on, as this would have a tendency to burn the dough. The drainpipe valve is always partially open to produce a circulation. I also show and prefer to use a plurality of valves, as this enables me to distribute the heat more uniformly than would a single valve. The inlet-valves are also only slightly open when the press is operating.  \n  In practice I have found the foregoing-described construction to produce a more uniform and superior product than can be obtained under ordinary methods, that the press has a considerably-increased capacity, and that a great saving of time and labor is efi\u0026#39;ected by the die arrangement and the spreading and cutting mechanism.  \n  It is possible that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the principle of my invention, and I do not wish to be understood as limiting myself to the specific structure here shown and described.  \n I claim 1. A paste-press having in combination a cylinder, a plunger to operate therein, means for operating the lunger, a perforated die in the cylinder, anc a hinged member below the die upon which the formed tubes are received and held during a subsequent cutting operation.  \n  2.

Serial No. 257,243. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo a w/wnt it nuty concern: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Be it known that I, CAESAR R. SPLIVALO, a citizen of the United States, residing in the city and county of San Francisco, State of California, have invented new and useful Im provements in Paste-Presses, of which the following is a specification. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention relates to improvements in presses used in the preparation of macaroni and like paste products. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is customary in the present state of the art to employ a steam-jacketed cylinder, into which the paste in bulk is delivered and by power to force the paste through suitable dies in the bottom of the cylinder to form tubes, strings, or strips, which on being dried form the macaroni ,vermicclli, and other dried paste products of commerce. The press-cylinder being round, the heat of the steam in the surrounding jacket penetrates inwardly on all sides to heat the paste to give it its required degree of plasticity and mobility; but as the penetrating power of the heat is limited generally to about four inches in any one direction the capacity of these round presses is reduced accordingly. I/Vhere it is attempted, as it sometimes is, to make the press-cylinder much over eight inches in diameter, the interior portions of the paste are found to be more or less unaffected by the heat, resulting in an inferior product. Moreover, the steam in these cylindrical presses acting unequally on the body of paste causes parts of it to flow out through the dies more rapidly than other portions, thereby producing tubes of different length. The operator from time to time cuts off a bundle of these exuded paste tubes, which are by subsequent handling rearranged in rows in single layers on the drying-trays. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention comprehends the constructing of a press-box with a bore which in crosssection shall have a major axis of indefinite length and a minor axis of a length not to exceed the distance to which steam may penetrate from opposite sides of the press-box. In other words, I may have a press-box oval or oblong in cross-section, and the major axis or space between the ends of the oval or oblong may be from two to six feet or more, while the minor axis or the space between the side walls of the box will not exceed, say, eight inches where the effective penetrating power of the steam from either side does not exceed four inches. The result of this 0011- struction is the more thorough and equable heating of all the contained paste to cause it to How through the dies evenly and also the production of a machine of greatly-increased capacity over those now employed. Furthermore, by providing a die corresponding in shape to the bottom of the press-box and having suitably-staggered perforations and by arranging suitable spreading and cutting mechanism underneath the cylinder I am able to take the tubes as they come from the die, spread them directly onto the trays or onto sheets of paper to be slid onto the trays ready for drying Without the expense and loss of time of a second or third handling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having reference to the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a vertical section taken longitudinally through my apparatus on line X X, Fig. 2. Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the same. Fig. 3 is an end elevation of the spreading and -cutting mechanism. Fig. 4 is a plan of a die. Fig. 5 is a section of the same. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e A represents my improved impression-cylinder or press-box, here shown as having a bore oblong in cross-section with a steamjacket 2 adjacent to its end and on its longer sides only. The space between the longer sides of the box is less than twice the efiective penetrating distance of the steam from the jacket on either side. Hence no end acket is necessary, thereby lessening the cost of construction, while the sides of the box may be prolonged to any suitable length within the power of the compression means. Preferably the box is made in two sections adapted to be assembled and bolted together by the bolts 3, as shown. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 4. is a plunger corresponding in shape and area to the bore of the box. It is carried by the piston-rod 5, operated by any suitable means, as the hydraulic cylinder 6. The latter is suitably mounted above and connected rigidly with the press-box by means of the tie-rods or columns 7. The plunger is ada ted to be retracted above the opening in t 1e ress to give sufficient clearance for the infeed of the paste. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Power is applied in the usual fashion to reciprocate the plunger to express the contents of the press-box through the perforations in the die 8, which is suitably-supported in the bottom of the box. This die is of a construction common to (presses of this character and with any style or shape of may be provide from the die. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eperforations desired. As here shown, the perforations are round. A central core 9 is rovided in each perforation, which forms the hollow of the paste-tube. The die is supported at its edges by an internal ledge in the bottom of the cylinder and rests on a central and longitudinally-extending braceplate or strongback 10, carried from the press by the stirrups 11. This strong-back 10 serves a double purpose: first, to support the die against the thrust of the plunger, and, secondly, to divide the exuded tubes into two parts and to form a support for the inclined boards 12, one of which boards directs part of the tubes to one side of the machine, and the other board directs the remaining tubes to the other side of the machine. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The perforations in the die-plate are pref erably arranged and staggered, so that the tubes issuing therethrough will not stand directly one behind another, but will permit the two bundles to be laid out or spread substantially flat in single layers on the receiving surface or surfaces held beneath the die. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The press is preferably mounted on an ele vated support to allow plenty of room for the roper handling of the tubes as they come As here shown, the tubes from either side of the machine are received onto corresponding inclined boards or deflectors 13 and pass beneath the respective knives 14 onto the hinged boards or shelves 15. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The parts 12, 13, 14, and 15, with their cooperating mechanisms, are duplicated, so that it is understood that the description of the portion of the spreading and cutting device for the tubes issuing from one side of the die is the same for that on the other side of the machine. This spreading and cutting device may be mounted on a frame B, capable of being moved in under and out from beneath the cylinder at any time it is desired. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The deflectors 13 are fixed permanently in the frame B, and the boards or shelves 15 are hinged or pivoted in the frame, as shown at 16, and extend up underneath the deflectors 13 and sufliciently out of contact therewith to permit one or more sheets of paper or a tray or other receiving medium to be laid on a hinged board or shelf 15 and pass up underneath a corresponding deflector 13, the tray or paper forming the medium on which the tubes as they hang in long strings from the press are received. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In practice I generally arrange for a number of sheets of paper to be laid on each of the shelves 15, with the upper ends of the sheets passed up through the space between the lower edge of a deflecting-board 13 and its corresponding shelf 15 and secured by suitable means, as the pins or tacks 16, to the upper edge of the shelf. Knowing the number of trays of tubes that a single charge of the press will fill, I provide an appropriate number ofsheets of paper for each of the hinged shelves 15, since each sheet is intended to correspond to a tray. The knives 14 are supported in slots 17 in the ends of frame B and have a movement to and from their respective deflecting-boards 12 corresponding with the turning of the boards 15 about their pivots. a spring 18, operating normally to hold the knives away from the boards 12. The latter are each preferably cut away to provide a ledge 19, with which the cutting edge of a knife cooperates when moved in against the board to sever a bunch of tubes. The movement of the knives is so related to the movement of the respective hinged shelves 15 that when a bunch of tubes on one side or the other of the machine has gradually been forced out, so that it extends substantially to the bottom of a shelf 15, the latter may be turned on its hinges into a position indicated in dotted lines, Fig. 1, whereupon the corresponding knife 14 will be actuated to sever this particular bunch of tubes, leaving them supported entirely on the shelf 15 or upon a sheet of paper upon the shelf. The severance however, of the bunch preferably does not take place until the shelf has assumed such a flat angle that the tubes will not slide off when the knife comes down. VVith either of the shelves in the position as indicated in dotted lines, Fig. 1, its incumbent load can be slid onto a tray 20, supported on the table Each end of each knife is connected to 21, by simply taking hold of the topmost 15 is here shown as follows: Relative to each knife and shelf and at each end of a knife and outside of frame B is a bar 22, having a slot 23 at one end, in which the bar is pivoted, as at 24, to permit of a limited reciprocating movement of the bar, as well as a pivotal movement of the same. The bars 22 are notched, as at 25, and are each connected by a strap 26 or equivalent flexible connection with the adjacent end of a knife. The straps pass over rollers 27, so as to bring a direct pull on a knife when any two bars which are connected to the knife are pulled down by the engagement of the prongs 28 on the lateral projections 29 on a corresponding shelf 15. These projections 29 are here shown comprising the ends of a cross-bar attached to a shelf and. extending through and workto cause that knife to be actuated to sever the bunch of tubeson that side of the machine at the proper moment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e As previously stated, it is desired that the severance of the bunch of tubes will not take place until the shelf has been lifted into about the position indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 1. As soon as the tubes are severed there is no need of the knife remaining longer, so I provide a means by which the knife is released before the shelf has completed its up ward movement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e As here shown, screws 31 are carried by the bars and engage the end of a projection 29 on a shelf at the proper moment to push the bars away from the projections 29 and release them from the prongs 28. Some adjustable means, as the screws 31, are desirable, so as to enable the two bars which are connected with a knife to be released simultaneously and cause both ends of the knife to be retracted at the same time. Thus it will be seen that a knife is operated and released by a simple upward movement of a shelf, and the operation of the knife being quite rapid the continued downward feed of the tubes from the die is not interfered with. As a matter of fact the tubes feed out very slowly, and it takes from fifty to sixty minutes to run a charge of paste through the press. By this construction of pressbox, spreading, and cutting mechanism one operator is able to handle the entire output of the machine, spread it and deliver it into a tray for drying. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In order to equably heat the steam-jacket or portions of the steam-jacket, I prefer to have the steam-pipe 32 provided with a plurality of inlets 33, each controlled by a separate valve 34. As these inlets enter at different places in the length of the jacket, it is possible to regulate the heat for all portions of the paste, so that all the tubes will be of uniform quality and will flow at a uniform rate of speed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e If it is found that any portion of the tubes does not flow as it should, the cocks 34, controlling the part of the cylinder from which these particular tubes are coming, may be turned on or off to either heat up or cool that part of the paste, as may be needed. Drain from the steam jacket may take place through the pipe In operating the press the full pressure of steam is not put on, as this would have a tendency to burn the dough. The drainpipe valve is always partially open to produce a circulation. I also show and prefer to use a plurality of valves, as this enables me to distribute the heat more uniformly than would a single valve. The inlet-valves are also only slightly open when the press is operating. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In practice I have found the foregoing-described construction to produce a more uniform and superior product than can be obtained under ordinary methods, that the press has a considerably-increased capacity, and that a great saving of time and labor is efi'ected by the die arrangement and the spreading and cutting mechanism. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is possible that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the principle of my invention, and I do not wish to be understood as limiting myself to the specific structure here shown and described. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI claim 1.

Serial No- 269,081-  \n To all whom it may concern:  \n . Be it known that I, WILLIAM K. HENRY, a citizen of the United States, residing at New Britain, Hartford county, Connecticut, have invented certain new and useful Im provements in Door Checks and Closers, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.  \n  My invention relates to improvements in door-checks, and the sarneis of particular advantage when employed in connection with a door-closer, for example, such as set forth in my application, Serial No. 259,082, filed May 6, 1905,  \n  The main object of my invention is to provide an eflective liquid door-check which may be easily assembled and which is of such construction that it may be used without changing the internal mechanism upon either a right or a left hand door.  \n In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a longitudinal section of the door-check and a part of the closer, the balance of the latter being shown in elevation. Fig. 2 is a crosssection of the check-casing with one of the pistons removed. In this view a cross-section of the closer mechanism is partly shown, while the balance is shown in elevation. Fig. 3 is a view of the lower part of the spindle with the crank thereon. Fig. 4 is a plan View of one of the connecting-rods; Fig. 5 is a plan View of another connecting-rod. Fig. 6 is a plan view of the packing-gland. Fig. 7 is a plan view of the packing. Fig. 8 is a plan View of the crank-supporting nut.  \n 1 designates a cylinder constituting the liq- 2 3 designate pistons arranged therein.  \n  4=designates the spindle having suitable bearings. The lower part of the spindle is I furnished with a crank portion furnishing the two opposite cranks 5 and 6, arranged one above the other so as to receive the connecting-rods 7 8, respectively. Both cranks 5 6 are made integral, and the construction is such that both connecting-rods may be applied thereto quickly and easily. This is accomplished by constructing the crank-pin of crank 5 of considerably greater diameter than the crank 6 and its crank-pin, so that the enlarged strap portion 7 a of the connecting-rod 7 may be easily passed over the-crank 6 and the adjacent support and then slipped into place on the pin of crank 5. The diameter of the strap 7 a is large enough to slip freely over any portion of the lower crank and crank-pin, and the assembling of the cranks and the strap ends of the connecting-rods is eifected before the spindle-bearings are attached to the case, at which time if the heads of the cylinder 1 are assembled the various parts may be turned freely so as to effect said connection.  \n 9 designates a cotter-pin or other suitable I device which maybe secured to the crank 5 after the connecting-rod 7 is in place to prevent it from dropping down or tilting out of alinement.  \n  10 1O designate the wrist-pins.  \n  11 12 designate check-valves for the pistons 2 3, respectively.  \n  Around the cylinder from end to end is a by-pass 13. 14 designates a communicating passage from the space between the pistons to said by-pass 13. (See Fig. 2.) 15 designates a valve whereby the size of this communicating passage 14: may be varied at will. The pistons 2 3 are shown in their normal inactive position. When the door is opened, the spindle 4 is turned, and the pistons 2 3 are moved away from each other and toward the opposite ends of the cylinder 1. During this movement the liquid freely passes the check-valves 11 12. When, however, the door starts to close, the liquid between the pistons .is prevented from flowing through the passages inthe pistons, since the check-valves 1 1 12 automatically close said passages. It is thennecessary for the iiquid to flow through the communicating passage 14: into the bypass 13 and thence to the cylinder ends. By this means the door may be opened freely, but is checked as it closes.  \n  I need not describe the closing mechanlsm in detail, since that is set forth in my abovereferred-to application. Suflice it to say that 16 is a casing affording a spring-chamber within the same.  \n  17 designates the spring, the same belng suitably connected to the spindle 4:. The spring-chamber is closed off from the liquidchamber by a partition 18, through which the spindle 4 passes. Between the walls of the partition 18 and the spindle are packing-washers 19 19, of suitable material, held in place by a gland 20, screw-threaded into a sleevelike extension on said partition 18. Underneath the packing-washers 19 may be a spring 21. The packing-washers 19 are caused to snugly fit against the side walls by the pressure of the spring 21 and the restraining influence of the gland 20, and thus prevent the leakage of oil.  \n  22 designates a nut screw-threaded on the spindle 4 and arranged to draw it up into proper position preparatory to assembling the parts located above the check.  \n From the foregoing it will be seen that the cranks 5 6 being out of line will receive theconnecting-rods in such manner that they will not interfere in crossing the center, no matter which way the spindle 4- is turned. The connecting-rods may be made integrally, -it being unnecessary to open the ring 7* at the end of the upper rod 7 when the parts are assembled.- It is also possible to assemble these parts withoutdismembering the crank. With a construction other than that set forth herein it would be impossible to connect the upper ticular advantage when the check is origi-\u0026#39; nally assembled. The advantage of employing a relatively small opening for the admission .or removal of the liquid is that the danger of leakage is substantially reduced. Furthermore, it permits the caps 23 24 to be secured to the cylinder ends with a suitable cement or other packing material, which renders the same absolutely-liquid-tight, and it is, neces sary in introducing or{-removing the liquid from the cylinder to break thesejoints. The admission-port closed by the .plug 25 is so small relatively to the size of the cap that it is a very easy matter to effectively pack the, same and render it liquid-tight by the use of a small packingwasher.  \n What I claim is 1. In a door-check, acylinder, aspindle having two cranks at its lower end, said cranks being arranged oppositely and in difierent planes, thelowermost crank being free-ended, the diameter of the crank-pin nearest the spindle being substantially greater than the diameter of the other crank-pin and crank, pistons, connecting-rods between said pistons and said crank-pins, the strap end of .one\u0026#39;of said connecting rods being of suficient diameter to freely pass over one of said crank-pins and crank-arms to engage the othercrank-pin.  \n  2. In combination, a cylinder, two pistons therein. a spindle having two cranks, said cranks being arranged oppositely and in different planes, connecting-rods having strap ends, said rods adapted to said cranks and arranged between said cranks and said pistons, the strap-bearings of the crank-pins of said cranks corresponding respectively to said straps, one Ofsaid connecting-rod straps be.- ing \u0026#39;ofgreater diameter than the other to slip over one of said crank-pins and cranks and properly engage the othencrank, the closer mechanism including springchamber and spring and a liquid tight partition between said cylinder and said spring-chamber.  \n 3. In a door-check, acylinder, two pistons,  \n a spindle having two cranks and crank-pin, oppositely arranged and in difierent-planes,  \n the diameter ofthe upper crank-pin being greater than the diameter. of the other pin and crank, and connecting-rods having strap ends between said rank-pins and said pistons, the strap\u0026#39;en\u0026#39;d of one of said rods being sufficiently-large to slip over one of said cranks and crank-pin and\u0026#39;fit the other pin.  \n - WILLIAM K.

M. WILDE.  \n CANDLE HOLDER.  \n APPLICATION FILED DOT. 26,1905.  \n UNITED STATES PATENT orFICE.  \n CANDLE-HOLDER.  \n Specification of Letters Patent.  \n Patented Feb. 13, 1906.  \n Application filed October 26,1905- Serial No, 284,416i  \n To (all who)? it may concern:  \n  Be it known that I, LEwIs M. VVILDE, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of North Walpole, in the county of Cheshire and State of New Hampshire, have invented an Improvement in Candle-Holders, of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specification, like characters on the drawings representirg like parts.  \n  This invention relates to a can dle-holder which has been especially designed for use in religous services, although it will be evident that the candle-holder may be used in a great variety of places.  \n  The invention comprises a counterweighted candle-receptacle to receive the candle, means to engage the lighted end of the candle, so as to maintain the flame at substantially a fixed point, and means to vary the el\u0026#39;lective weight of the counterweight as the candle burns.  \n  I will first describe one embodiment of my invention and then point out the novel features thereof in the appended claims.  \n  Figure 1 is a vertical longitudinal section of an improved candle-holder embodying my invention. Fig. 2 is a vertical view thereof at right angles to Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a section on the line x :0, Fig. 2. Fig. 4 is a section on the line y y. Fig. 5 is a top plan view of Fig. 1. Fig. 6 is an enlarged view of the top of Fig. 1. Fig. 7 is a detail showing the manner in which the snufting device operates, and Fig. 8 is a view showing the manner of insertin g the candle into the holder.  \n  The candle, which is designated by 3, is received and sustained by a candle-receptacle 4, which is capable of vertical movement and which in this embodiment of my invention is guided in its movements by suitable guides5. These guides are secured at one end to a lower head 6 and at the other end to an upper head or top piece 7, the latter having a central aperture 8 therein, through which the exposed portion of the wick of the candle extends.  \n  The candle-receptacle and candle contained therein are counter weighted, the counterweight being of such a size as to overbalance the weight of the candle and receptacle, and thereby tend to keep the candle elevated. In order to maintain the flame at a constant point at the top of the holder, I have provided suitable means, hereinafter to be described,  \n to engage the lighted end of the candle, the candle being held against said means by the counterweight.  \n  The counterweight is designated generally by 9, and it is shown as made in two sections 10 and 11. The section 11 is secured to the candle-receptacle by means of flexible cords 12, which pass over guide-pulleys 13, secured to the top head 7 The section 10 of the counterweight restsloosely on the lower section 11 and suitable means are provided to relieve the candle-receptacle of the top section 10 as the candle burns, and the counterweight consequently descends, so that when the candle is nearly burned out the e\u0026#39;l\u0026#39;lective weight of the counterweight will be decreased. To accomplish this, I have provided certain of the guides 5 with projections or stops 14 (see Fig. 3) and have provided the upper section 10 of the counterweight with other projections or lugs 15, which, are adapted to engage the projections 14 as the counterweight descends. The projections 14 are so positioned that when the candle gets approximately half burned out the projections on the counterweight-section 10 engage the stops 11, thereby relieving the candle-receptacle of the upper section of the counterweight. The weight of the section 1 1 is such that it will slightly overbalance the weight of the candle-receptacle and the remaining portion of the candle.  \n  The means I have herein shown for engaging the lighted end of the candle comprises dogs or pawls 16, pivoted to either the top piece 7 or to the guides 5, said dogs each having a nose portion 17 adapted to project over the top of the candle, as shown in Fig. 2, and thereby prevent the candle from being ejected through the aperture 8 by the counterweight. By using pivoted dogs for this purpose a fresh candle may be readily inserted into the holder, as shown in Fig. 8, the dogs swinging on their pivots to permit the candle to enter. IVhen the candle has been entirely inserted, the dogs swing into their operative position, with their nose overthe end of the candle by the action of gravity.  \n  I have also shown a device for automatically extinguishing the candle when it is nearly exhausted. The extinguisher herein shown is in the form of a lid or cover 20 for the aperture 8, said lid being hinged to the cap 7, as at 21,and being acted on by a suitable spring 22, which tends normally to close the cover.  \n The cover is held in its open position by latch 23, which is herein shown as slidably mounted on or in one of th\u0026#39;eguides 5. Said latch has projecting from its lower end a projection or ear 24, which is in position to be en gaged by a projection 25 on the candle-receptacle as the latter approaches the upper end of the holder. When, therefore, the candle is nearly burned out and the candle-receptacle has been forced nearly to the top of the holder, the projection 25 engages the ear 24 and raises the latch 23, thus releasing the cover 20 and allowing it to close. The closing of the door obviously extinguishes the candle. After the candle has been extinguished a new candle may be readily inserted, as above described.  \n  I propose to inclose the parts thus far described in a suitable casing 26, which may have any suitable or usual construction. The casing is shown as having a plurality of airholes .27 to supply the necessary air for the proper burning of the flame.  \n It will be noted from Fi s. 1 and 6 that the base of the flame is slight y below the aper-\u0026#39; ture 8, and by providing the air-holes 27 sufficient air is supplied to the flame so that the candle will burn freely and without smoking.  \n The guide-rods 5, with their attached heads,  \n and the candle are preferably made removable from the casing 26, sothat, if desired, said guide-rods may be removed entirely from the casing to permit the parts to be cleaned or repaired.  \n  Various changes in the construction of the device may be made without departing from the invention.  \n  Having described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. In a candle-holder, a counterweighted vertically movable candle receptacle, and means to vary the effective weight of the counterweight as the candle burns.  \n  2. In a candle-holder, a vertically-movable candle-receptacle, a counterweight connected to the receptacle, and means to relieve the receptacle of a portion of the weight of the counterweight as said receptacle moves upwardly due to the burning of the candle.  \n  3. In a candle-holder, a counterweighted vertically-movable candle-receptacle, means to engage the lighted end of the candle to maintain the flame in a constant position, and  \n means to vary the eflective weight of the counterweight as the candle burns.  \n  4. In a candle-holder, a vertically-movable candle-receptacle, means to engage the lighted end of the candle thereby to maintain the flame in a constant position, a counterweight connected to the receptacle, and means to relieve the receptacle of a portion of the weight of the counterweight as said receptacle moves upwardly.  \n  5. In a candle-holder, a vertically-movable candle-receptacle, a counterweight connected thereto, means to guide the candle-receptacle in its movement, and means to relieve it of a portion of the weight of the counterweight as the\u0026#39;candle burns.  \n  6. In a candle-holder, a vertically-movable candle-receptacle, a counterweight connected thereto, said counterweight being made in two parts, and means to arrest the movement of one part of the counterweight when the candle is partly burned.  \n  \u0026#39;7. In a candle-holder, a vertically-movable candle-receptacle, a counterweight connected to said receptacle, said counterweight be ing made in two parts, a stop to engage one part as the counterweight descends and thereby relieve the candle-receptacle of a portion 3 of the weight of the counterweight.  \n  8. In a candle-holder, avertically-movable candle-receptacle, guide-rods between which the receptacle moves and by which it is guided, a counterweight encircling the guidebars and connected to the receptacle, said counterweight being made in two parts, and means to arrest the movement of one of the parts when the candle is partially burned.  \n  9. In a candle-holder, a vertically-movable candle-receptacle, a counterweight therefor, and pivoted dogs to engage the lighted end of the candle.  \n  10. In a candle-holder, a vertically-movable candle-receptacle, guide-rods between which said receptacle moves and by which it is guided, a guideway for the receptacle, and dogs pivoted to the guides and adapted to engage the upper end of the candle.  \n In testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \n  LEWIS M.

PATENTED FEB. 13, 1906. B. M. LANG, JR: WIRE FINISHING TOOL.  \n APPLICATION FILED MAY25, 1904.  \n PATENT OFFICE.  \n EDWARD M. LANG, JR,  \n OF PORTLAND, MAINE.  \n WIRE-FINISHING TOOL.  \n Specification of Letters Patent.  \n Patented Feb. 13, 1906.  \n Application filed May 25, 1904. Serial No. 209.645-  \n To all whom it may concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, EDWARD M. LANG, Jr., a citizen of the United States, residing at Portland, in the county of Cumberland and State of Maine, have invented an Improvement in Wire-Finishing Tools; and I hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, which will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same.  \n  My invention relates to the manufacture, and especially the finishing, of wire of solder and similar material, and particularly to wire which has been cast either upon the surface of revolving wheels or disks or otherwise. Such wire is not always of uniform size throughout, but, on the contrary, may at dif ferent points vary in diameter. It is desirable for various uses to reduce it to a uniform size. This may be done by drawing, which is, however, a long and therefore expensive process, or by shaving; but this method is objectionable in that a part of the substance of the wire is removed, leaving much material either to be wasted or recast.  \n  It is the purpose of the tool whichis the subject of my invention to reduce such cast wire to a uniform size. The tool consists of a series of two or more sets or pairs of grooved wheels so located that the opposite sides of every portion of the wire will in succession pass between and be compressed by the grooves of the wheels.- As will be perceived, the simplest combination to effect this purpose is two pairs of wheels, the plane of revolution of one pair being at right angles, or practically so, with the plane of revolution of the other. Should three sets be used, the most desirable arrangement and location will be such that the plane of rotation of each pair of wheels will be at an angle of sixty degrees to the plane of revolution of the pairs of wheels on either side. It is believed, however, that two pairs of wheels arranged as above described will be found elfectual in all cases, and the succeeding description will be confined to a tool carrying but two pairs of wheels arranged at right angles to each other.  \n  Referring to the drawings in which my device is shown, Figure 1 is a side elevation. Fig. 2 is a top plan, and Fig. 3 is a detail of the shafts carrying the wheels. I  \n  In the drawings, a a represent a bracket which supports the operative parts of the tool and may be substantially of the shape shown in Fig. 2, the central portion being provided with an arm 7), extending substantially at right angles with the other ortion of the bracket. In front of the arm the bracket is provided with circular apertures to receive the shafts c 0. These shafts are made of two diameters, the portion with the larger diameter being adapted to be held in the aperture in the bracket. The other portion of the shaft is of smaller diameter and is connected eccentrically with the larger portion. (See Fig. 3.) They are also each provided with a collar cl, located at such distance from the larger end of the shaft as to permit the latter to pass through the aperture and receive the nut e, by which the shaft is rigidly secured in the bracket. The other or smaller end of the shaft carries the grooved wheel f, the latter being held upon the shaft by the nut g. Another pair of similar shafts and wheels are located in like manner upon the arm I) of the bracket. The two pairs of shafts-that is to say, those on the main portion of the bracket and those on the arm bmust always be so located that the wheels carried by one set will revolve in the plane in which those of the other. set revolve and that the plane of the center of the grooves of one pair of wheels will pass midway between the center of the grooves of the other pair of wheels. The space between the wheels of each pair or set may be increased or diminished by loosening the nut e and turning the shafts either up or down until the new position is obtained, when the nut is again set up, thus securely holding the shaft between the nut and the collar d. Absolute exactness in this instance may be obtained by the use of a age or by other similar means. In front of the first-described pair of wheels the bracket (1 is provided with a tubular guide h, (see Figs. 1 and 2,) which shall be so located that the axis of its longitudinal opening will be substantially in the plane of both pairs of wheels. The rear end of the bracket is provided with an appropriate journal, in which revolves the shaft 7), which is provided at one end with a pulley Z and carries at the other end the smaller shaft 7c, which is provided with a spline. On this shaft 7c is placed the spool j, having at the side of its circular opening a recess to receive the spline.  \n  In operation the wire as cast is carried through the guide h, and the end which has been pointed or somewhat reduced in diameter to permit of its easyintroductionis passed through the grooves of each pair of wheels by hand until suflicient has passed between the wheels to enable the end to be attached to the spool upon the shaft 7c, when power is applied to the pulley Z by means of the belt m or otherwise, and the wire is thereafter continuously drawn between the wheels until the spool is filled, when the wire is cut and the spool removed and another substituted, to which the wire is secured as before and the process repeated. The passage of the wire through the grooves of the first pair of wheels reduces it to a uniform size, but leaves it oval in shape with a slight fin on either side. Its passage through the second pair of wheels obliterates the fin and renders it substantially uniformly round. As the pressure to which the wheels ff are subjected is great, friction may, if it is desired, be reduced by using ballbearings or other devices for the purpose of reducing the friction.  \n What I claim is 1. In a wire-finishing machine, the combination with a support, of a reducingroll mounted thereon, a rotary adjustable shaft carried by said support, means for locking same in its adjusted position, a pintle eccentrically disposed on the end of said shaft beside said roll, and a second roll mounted on said pintle.  \n  2. In a wire-finishing machine, the combination with a support, of a parallel pair of rotary adjustable shafts carried thereby with means for locking said shafts in a fixed position, eccentrically-disposed pintles on the ends of said shaft, and reducing-rolls on said pintles disposed in the same plane.  \n  In testimony that I claim the foregoing as my invention I have hereunto set my hand this 23d day of May, A.

Serial No. 209.645- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo all whom it may concern.- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Be it known that I, EDWARD M. LANG, Jr., a citizen of the United States, residing at Portland, in the county of Cumberland and State of Maine, have invented an Improvement in Wire-Finishing Tools; and I hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, which will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e My invention relates to the manufacture, and especially the finishing, of wire of solder and similar material, and particularly to wire which has been cast either upon the surface of revolving wheels or disks or otherwise. Such wire is not always of uniform size throughout, but, on the contrary, may at dif ferent points vary in diameter. It is desirable for various uses to reduce it to a uniform size. This may be done by drawing, which is, however, a long and therefore expensive process, or by shaving; but this method is objectionable in that a part of the substance of the wire is removed, leaving much material either to be wasted or recast. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is the purpose of the tool whichis the subject of my invention to reduce such cast wire to a uniform size. The tool consists of a series of two or more sets or pairs of grooved wheels so located that the opposite sides of every portion of the wire will in succession pass between and be compressed by the grooves of the wheels.- As will be perceived, the simplest combination to effect this purpose is two pairs of wheels, the plane of revolution of one pair being at right angles, or practically so, with the plane of revolution of the other. Should three sets be used, the most desirable arrangement and location will be such that the plane of rotation of each pair of wheels will be at an angle of sixty degrees to the plane of revolution of the pairs of wheels on either side. It is believed, however, that two pairs of wheels arranged as above described will be found elfectual in all cases, and the succeeding description will be confined to a tool carrying but two pairs of wheels arranged at right angles to each other. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Referring to the drawings in which my device is shown, Figure 1 is a side elevation. Fig. 2 is a top plan, and Fig. 3 is a detail of the shafts carrying the wheels. I \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the drawings, a a represent a bracket which supports the operative parts of the tool and may be substantially of the shape shown in Fig. 2, the central portion being provided with an arm 7), extending substantially at right angles with the other ortion of the bracket.

Serial No. 241,097.  \n To all whmn it nuty concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, WILLIAM MONROE OAR- BIKER, a citizen of the United States, residing at Irving, in the county of Montgomery and State of Illinois, have invented a new and useful Neck-Yoke, of which the following is a specification.  \n  The invention relates to improvements in neck-yokes.  \n  The object of the present invention is to improve the construction of neckyokes, more especially the neck-yoke center or the means for connecting a neck-yoke with a tongue or pole, and to provide a simple, inexpensive, and efficient construction designed for use on all kinds of vehicles, mowers, and binders adapted to permit a neck-yoke to be readily applied, to and removed from a tongue or pole and capable of securely connecting the neck-yoke and the tongue or pole and of efiectually preventing the same from becoming disconnected when the parts are in use.  \n  A further object of the invention is to provide a device of this character capable of adjusting itself automatically to the movement of the neck-yoke and the tongue or pole and adapted to arrange the neck-yoke close to the extreme end of a tongue or pole, so that the latter will not project and catch into a fence or the like should the team be hitched to one of the posts.  \n  The invention also has for its object to provide a construction in which the lines will not catch and whichwill permit an ordinary neckyoke to be used on a pole or tongue temporarily, if desired.  \n  With these and other objects in view the invention consists in the construction and novel combination and arrangement of parts, hereinafter fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings, and pointed out in the claims hereto appended, it being understood thatvarious changes in the form, proportion, size, and minor details of construction within the scope of the claims may be resorted to without departing from the spirit or sacrificing any of the advantages of the invention.  \n  In the drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of a neck-yoke constructed in accordance with this invention. Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional view taken longitudinally of the neck-yoke. Fig. 3 is a similar view taken longitudinally of the pole-tip. Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the pole-tip. Fig. 5 is a horizontal sectional view on the line 5 5 of Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is a perspective view of the pole-engaging ring and the upper and lower coupling members. Fig. 7 is a perspective view of the neck-yoke, illustrating a modification of the invention. Fig. 8 is a vertical sectional view of the same.  \n  Like numerals of reference designate corresponding parts in all the figures of the drawings.  \n  1 designates a pole-tip, having a socket 2, and adapted to fit over the front end of a tongue or pole. The sides of the tip are extended beyond the socket to form arms 3, which are perforated for the reception of suitable fastening devices for securing the tip to a pole or tongue. The outer end 4 of the tip is rounded and is provided with an opening. The front portion of the tip is adapted to receive a neck-ring 5, and it has an annular flange or rib 6, forming a stop for the neckyoke ring.  \n  The neck-yoke ring, which is provided with an interior annular groove 7, is locked on the tip by a pair of oppositely-disposed catches 8, consisting of curved heads or engaging portions spaced from the rib and mounted on longitudinal springs 9, and adapted to extend into the annular groove of the neck-yoke ring when the latter is placed on the tip. The springs, which extend longitudinally of the pole-tip at opposite sides thereof, are arranged in longitudinal grooves 10 of the same and are secured at their inner ends to the tip. The tip is provided at the frontends of the grooves with intersecting recesses 11, arranged to receive the engaging portions or heads of the catches for permitting the same to be moved inwardly out of engagement with the neckyoke ring. The springs extend forwardly beyond the heads or engaging portions of the catches, and project into. front sockets 12, formed in the walls of the recesses 11. springs extend beneath the annular rib or flange 6 and have their outward movement limited by the same. The outer faces of the engaging portions of the catches are beveled toward. the front to enable the neck-yoke ring to be readily placed on the pole-tip, and. the rear edges of the heads or engaging portions form shoulders for retaining the neckyoke ring on the pole-tip. The pole-tip iscut away at opposite sides in rear of the annular rib or flange to form depressions 13, adapted to permit the springs to be readily pressed inward by the thumb and forefinger.  \n The p The neck-yoke ring is adapted to rotate on the end of the pole-tip, and it is pivoted at opposite sides by rivets 14 or other suitable pivots to the lower terminals of the sides of an arched \u0026#34;member 15, which constitutes the lower sections of a coupling and which is pivoted at the center of its top to an upper coupling block or member 16. The arched coupling member 15, which is arranged to swing backward and forward, is provided at its topwith an opening to receive the lower end 17 of the upper coupling member or block 16, which is rounded to form a vertical pivot and which is secured to the arched member by means of a screw 18 and a disk or plate 19. The screw 18 pierces the disk or plate and engages the coupling member 16 but any other suitable means may be employed for securing the parts together. The upper coupling block or member is provided with a transverse opening 20, arranged horizontally when the coupling block or member is vertical, and adapted to receive a transverse pivot 21, which also pierces a pair of ears 22 of a neckyoke 23. The ears 22, which are spaced apart, are formed integral with the lower plate 24 of the neck-yoke, which is also provided with an upper plate 25. These plates, which are secured to the neck-yoke by suitable fastening devices, are adapted to reinforce the same at the center. The neck-yoke ring is capable of a rotary movement on the pole-tip. The arched coupling member is adapted to swing backward and forward, and the upper coupling member has a rotary movement on the lower arched coupling member. The neck-yoke is also pivotally connected with the upper coupling member and is arranged to swing laterally of the tongue or pole. By this construction the connection between the neck-yoke and the tongue or pole is adapted to adjust itself automatically to the movement of the said parts.  \n  In Fig. 7 of the drawings is illustrated a modification of the invention, the neck-yoke 26 being provided with a central opening 27, in which is mounted a neck-yoke ring con- -structed like that heretofore described and provided with an annular groove 28 for engagement with the spring-actuated catches of the pole-tip. The neck-yoke 26 is composed of end portions or sections 29, con nected by plates or straps 30, arranged at the top and bottom of the neck-yoke and having extended ends overlapping the inner portions of the sections 29. The neck-yoke ring is provided with upper and lower pivots 31, which are arranged in openings of the top and bottom connecting-straps of the neckoke.  \n y The ends of the neck-yokes 23 and 26 are provided with suitable means for receiving the straps, chains, or other suitable flexible connections for connecting the neck-yokes with the rings.  \n  The pole-tipis provided at its bottom with a depending lug 32, spaced from and located in rear of the annular rib and adapted to enga e the ring of an ordinary neck-yoke to enable the same to be temporarily used when desired.  \n  It will be seen that the neck-yoke is simple and comparatively inexpensive in construction,\u0026#39; that it is adapted to be used on variour kinds of vehicles and farm implements, and that the tongue or pole will not catch in a fence when a team is hitched thereto or the lines become entangled with the neck-yoke.  \n  Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-  \n  1. In a device of the class described, the combination of a neck-yoke provided with a ring having an interior groove, a pole-tip receiving the ring, the latter being adapted for rotary movement on the former, and a catch carried by the pole-tip for engaging the annular groove of the ring.  \n  2. In a device of the class described, the combination of a neck-yoke, a neck-yoke ring, an arched coupling member piveted at opposite sides to the ring, and an upper coupling member pivoted to the\u0026#39;top of the arched coupling member to permit the neck-yoke to swing horizontally, and also pivoted to the neck-yoke for enabling the same to swing transversely of the ole.  \n  3.

The sides of the tip are extended beyond the socket to form arms 3, which are perforated for the reception of suitable fastening devices for securing the tip to a pole or tongue. The outer end 4 of the tip is rounded and is provided with an opening. The front portion of the tip is adapted to receive a neck-ring 5, and it has an annular flange or rib 6, forming a stop for the neckyoke ring. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The neck-yoke ring, which is provided with an interior annular groove 7, is locked on the tip by a pair of oppositely-disposed catches 8, consisting of curved heads or engaging portions spaced from the rib and mounted on longitudinal springs 9, and adapted to extend into the annular groove of the neck-yoke ring when the latter is placed on the tip. The springs, which extend longitudinally of the pole-tip at opposite sides thereof, are arranged in longitudinal grooves 10 of the same and are secured at their inner ends to the tip. The tip is provided at the frontends of the grooves with intersecting recesses 11, arranged to receive the engaging portions or heads of the catches for permitting the same to be moved inwardly out of engagement with the neckyoke ring. The springs extend forwardly beyond the heads or engaging portions of the catches, and project into. front sockets 12, formed in the walls of the recesses 11. springs extend beneath the annular rib or flange 6 and have their outward movement limited by the same. The outer faces of the engaging portions of the catches are beveled toward. the front to enable the neck-yoke ring to be readily placed on the pole-tip, and. the rear edges of the heads or engaging portions form shoulders for retaining the neckyoke ring on the pole-tip. The pole-tip iscut away at opposite sides in rear of the annular rib or flange to form depressions 13, adapted to permit the springs to be readily pressed inward by the thumb and forefinger. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe p The neck-yoke ring is adapted to rotate on the end of the pole-tip, and it is pivoted at opposite sides by rivets 14 or other suitable pivots to the lower terminals of the sides of an arched \"member 15, which constitutes the lower sections of a coupling and which is pivoted at the center of its top to an upper coupling block or member 16. The arched coupling member 15, which is arranged to swing backward and forward, is provided at its topwith an opening to receive the lower end 17 of the upper coupling member or block 16, which is rounded to form a vertical pivot and which is secured to the arched member by means of a screw 18 and a disk or plate 19. The screw 18 pierces the disk or plate and engages the coupling member 16 but any other suitable means may be employed for securing the parts together. The upper coupling block or member is provided with a transverse opening 20, arranged horizontally when the coupling block or member is vertical, and adapted to receive a transverse pivot 21, which also pierces a pair of ears 22 of a neckyoke 23. The ears 22, which are spaced apart, are formed integral with the lower plate 24 of the neck-yoke, which is also provided with an upper plate 25. These plates, which are secured to the neck-yoke by suitable fastening devices, are adapted to reinforce the same at the center. The neck-yoke ring is capable of a rotary movement on the pole-tip. The arched coupling member is adapted to swing backward and forward, and the upper coupling member has a rotary movement on the lower arched coupling member. The neck-yoke is also pivotally connected with the upper coupling member and is arranged to swing laterally of the tongue or pole. By this construction the connection between the neck-yoke and the tongue or pole is adapted to adjust itself automatically to the movement of the said parts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In Fig. 7 of the drawings is illustrated a modification of the invention, the neck-yoke 26 being provided with a central opening 27, in which is mounted a neck-yoke ring con- -structed like that heretofore described and provided with an annular groove 28 for engagement with the spring-actuated catches of the pole-tip. The neck-yoke 26 is composed of end portions or sections 29, con nected by plates or straps 30, arranged at the top and bottom of the neck-yoke and having extended ends overlapping the inner portions of the sections 29. The neck-yoke ring is provided with upper and lower pivots 31, which are arranged in openings of the top and bottom connecting-straps of the neckoke. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ey The ends of the neck-yokes 23 and 26 are provided with suitable means for receiving the straps, chains, or other suitable flexible connections for connecting the neck-yokes with the rings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The pole-tipis provided at its bottom with a depending lug 32, spaced from and located in rear of the annular rib and adapted to enga e the ring of an ordinary neck-yoke to enable the same to be temporarily used when desired. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It will be seen that the neck-yoke is simple and comparatively inexpensive in construction,' that it is adapted to be used on variour kinds of vehicles and farm implements, and that the tongue or pole will not catch in a fence when a team is hitched thereto or the lines become entangled with the neck-yoke. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is- \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 1.

IilNs, ot\u0026#39; Ashland, Iin the county of Schuylkill, and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Horse Hay-Forks; and I do hereby declare that the following is a sufliciently full, clear, and exact description thereof, toV enable one skilled iu the art to which my said inventionappertains toV make and use it, reference being had to the accompanying drawing which is made a part of this specification. t  \n  The subject of my invention is a horse hay-fork, cf novel and simple construction and operation. It co\u0026#39;nsists \u0026#39;ofI a pair o f jaws, composed of a plurality ot\u0026#39; tines, attached to a suitable handle or stock, the one by a rigid and the other by a hinge joint. The hinged or `movable jaw is connected, by means of a suitable rod or brace, to a slide or roller working in a recess in the face of the stock, and engaged by a suitable catch to lock thejaws in their closed position.  \n In the drawingsv Figure 1 yis a perspective view of my improved fork, in its closed or set position` Figure 2 is a side elevation thereof, open, and in the position in which it is driven into the hay.  \n  Figure 3 is a perspective view, showing a diiierent construction ofthe locking-devices from that represented in tlie other figures. i  \n Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding parts in the several figures.  \n  A may represent the stock or handle, which may be of any suitable form, and is provided at its upper end with aloop orieye, a, for the reception of the elevating-rope B, and has attached to it, at itslowerend,y a pair of jaws, C D, each o t\u0026#39; which is preferably composed of a plurality of tines, c cl, and are connected to said stock by the rigid-and hinged joints e cl respectively. v  \n  \u0026#39;E is a rigid brace, connectingl the iixedjaw C, ata suitable distance from its intersection with the stock A, tosaid stock, for the purpose of strengthening it, and F, a rod, similar to the brace E, connecting the movablejaw D,.\u0026#34;at a correspondingpoint, to the locking-devices. y l i I n figs. l and 2, the rod or brace F is represented as provided with a widened and slotted upper end,f, to adapt it for attachment to a sliding block, G, working in arecess, al, in the stock A, andA held from lateral displacement in said recess by `means of guides, g g.  \n  II is a spring-latch, attached to the-stock in any suitable manner, and/working in a slot, a2, in its face,\u0026#39; and adapted to engage with the upper lend ot\u0026#39; the block G, to hold said block in its depressed position, represented in iig. 1.  \n  In tig. 3, the widening and\u0026#39;slot-ting-of the cndf of the rod or brace F is represented as dispensed with, and said end of the same ora less width, working in the slot a2, which is elongated for that purpose.  \n  Theslide G is composed ot\u0026#39; suitable studs or pins projecting from the sides-oi` the rod, and occupying the recess al, the sides, of which are thus adapted to be closed, as represented at a3, thus greatly increasing the strength of this part. of the apparatus.  \n lThe latch H is` composed of a ilat bar\u0026#39;ot\u0026#39; metal, or other similar material, pivoted at its upper end, and  \n  adapted to close by gravity over the slide `G of the rod F, to hold the jaws intheir closed position,-as represented.  \n  I represents the trip-cord, whichis attached to the latch H, as shown.

It usually happens that the wick is turne up so far that although at first the flame is satisfactory in a little while it will be much larger \u0026#39;and will be smoking and causing a disagreeable smell to be evolved, the wick thus requiring often repeated regulating. Further, in extinguishing a lamp by turning down the wick there is considerable risk of the wick being turned down too far and out of range of the feed-wheel, and also there is danger of the flame being communicated to the vapors in the wick-tube and from there to the interior of the reservoir.  \n  The object of my invention is to obviate these defects; and it consists in providing a device directly connected to the spindle of the wick-regulating wheel and preventing when conveniently adjusted the risk of the wick being turned up and down too far. These operations may only be executed between -a certain limit found sufficient for producing the best or a determined luminous effect or for extinguishing the lamp.  \n  In the annexed drawings one form of my invention is shown.  \n  Figure 1 shows a perspective view of the invention. Fig. 2 shows the same device in position when a new wick is being inserted.  \n  As shown in the drawings, the spindle a of the wick-regulating wheel is provided with a finger or pin 1), the free end of which is adapted to .engage the groove 0 of a segment (1, which is secured to the burner. In this groove is arranged a slidable stop e, which may be shifted to different positions and fixed by means of a set-screw h. The groove is closed at one end and open at the other, so that the stop e may be drawn out of the groove, which is necessary when, for example, a new wick is being inserted or when the wick is burned down and a new regulation of it becomes necessary. The pin 1) may then be rotated so as to occupy the position shown in Fig. 2, so that the feed-wheel may be freely rotated.  \n  The function of the device is readily understood. The pinb engaging the stop at the end of the groove 0 limits the upward motion of the wick. The engagement of the finger b with the opposite stop 6 prevents the wick being turned down too far.  \n  It is obvious that the segment may be secured to the spindle a and the pin to the burner. The function would be the same.  \n  Having now fully described my said invention, what I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is  \n  1. In a lamp-burnerthe combination with the wick-regulating spindle, of a rotary pin supported on the spindle and adapted to be rotated round its axis upon the said spindle,  \n a finger at the upper or free end of the pin,  \n a grooved segment fixed to the lamp-casing which the said finger is adapted to engage, stops provided upon the said segment and adapted to limit the movement of said finger substantially as and for the purpose set forth.  \n  2.

Fig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. 1 with one of the bearing-plates and part of the mechanism removed to show more clearly the clockwork stop mechanism. Fig. 3 is a section on the line A B, Fig. 1, viewed in the direction of the arrow C; and Fig. 4 is a face view of the apparatus drawn to a smaller scale, showing the dial and index-finger at zero.  \n  a is a pinion mounted on a spindle which may be rotated by any suitable meansfor instance, by a flexible member, such as a small metallic endless cablefrom one of the wheels of the vehicle. The inion 0. gears with a wheel I), which is loosei y mounted on the spindle 19 and continually rotates in a contra-clockwise direction. Having one of its sides in frictional engagement with this wheel I) is a ratchet-wheel c, which is fast on the spindle 19 and rotates only when released, as hereinafter more fully described. This spindle 19 also carries the index-pointer 18, which revolves with the ratchet-wheel c. This pointer 18 when released rotates only a predetermined period of time and indicates on the dial 20 a speed proportional to the average speed of the vehicle for that timethat is, the pointer would indicate on the dial in the predetermined time (fifteen seconds in this case) the number of miles per hour at which the vehicle was traveling at that time. A smaller pinion d is also fast to the spindle 19 and gears with a toothed sector e, pivoted at f to the bearing-plate 1 and having a heel or flat part g, against which a pin or projection h is caused to act. The pin his attached to one end of alever pivoted at j to the bearing-plate 21.  \n  Pressure may be exerted in the direction of the arrow Z on the lever t by means of a ,push it to cause the other end m of this lever to move in the direction of the arrow n and come into contact with a pin or stud 0 on the shorter arm 1) of a bent lever q, pivoted at r to the plate 21 and terminating at the upper end of the longer arm in a finger s, which is constantly urged by a spring t to enter one of the four notches u, provided in the periphery of a disk 12, integral with and mounted on the same spindle as a wheel 90 and a pinion y. spring 2 presses against the lever t in a direc tion opposite to that of the arrow 1.  \n  On the plate 1 is pivoted at 2 an arm 3, connected with the lever q by means of a pin 4, attached to the said lever q. The pin 4 projects through an opening in the plate 1 and engages with a notch 5, provided in the top of the arm 3. The arm 3 is provided at the top with a nose or projection 6, capable of engaging with the teeth of the ratchet-wheel c. The arm q is provided with a shoulder 7, to which is fixed a thin blade-spring 8, Fig. 2, with which a pin or stud 9 on the balancewheel 10 of the clockwork can come into contact to stop the clock.  \n  The scape-wheel 11 is operated from a spring-barrel 12 through a train of wheels 13, 14, 15, 16 y as and 17, 17, being a pinion on the same arbor as and integral with the scapewheel 11.  \n  The diameter of the vehicle-wheel which drives the pinion a being known, the ratio of the wheel-gearing is calculated according to the divisions on the dial. The spring-barrel 12 being wound up and the index-finger 18 stationary at any division of the dial, the working of the apparatus is as follows:  \n  So long as no pressure is exerted on the push k the wheel I), which is operated by the pinion a, rotates on the arbor 19, the clockworkbeing held stationary, first, by the bladespring 8 bearing against the pin or stud 9 on the balance-wheel 10; secondly, by the nose or projection 6 of the lever g engaging the teeth of the ratchet-wheel c, and, lastly, by the finger s on the arm 3 engaging one oi the four notches u of the disk 1).  \n  If it be desired to ascertain the speed at which the vehicle fitted with the apparatus is running, the push 7c is pressed in the direction of the arrow Z. The sector a then under the action of the pin or projection h rotates the pinion d, and with it the arbor 19 and index-finger 18, bringing the said index-finger to position of zero on the dial, as shown in Fig. 4. At the same time the lower end m of the lever i, acting on the pin or stud 0, causes the bent lever g and arm 3 to move and disengage the nose 6 from the teeth of the wheel 6, the fingers s from the notch u in the disk t, which is controlled by the clock mechanism, to receive one complete revolution in a min ute, and remove the spring 8 away from the stud 9 on the balance-wheel, so that the clockwork is at once set in motion, whereby the index-:Fmge\u0026#39;r 18 is driven by the pinion a and the wheel I), which is in frictional engagement with the ratchet-wheel (2, until a notch u in the disk 1) is again engaged by the finger s. The push 7c is released as soon as the indexfinger 18 comes to the zero position on the dial, whereupon the lever t returns to its original position, and under the action of the spring 25 the finger s of the arm 3 bearson the disk 0, but without being able to enter the notch u, because the disk has in the meantime been set in motion by the clockwork. The finger s will therefore remain in contact with the periphery of the disk 1) and keep the nose 6 at a slight distance from the teeth of the ratchet-wheel c and the blade-spring 8 out of the path described by the pin or stud 9 on the balance-wheel until the disk v has made a quarter of a rotation, which occupies exactly fifteen seconds, when the next notch u in the periphery of the disk will be opposite the finger s, which finger will enter therein, and the nose 6 on the lever Q will engage with one of the teeth of the wheel 0 and immediately stop the index-linger 18 and the blade-sprin g 8, at the same time coming into the path of the pin or stud 9 on the balance-wheel and stop the clock. During the fifteen seconds the clockwork was working the index-finger 18 will have moved over the dial 20 to an extent proportional to the speed at which the vehicle is running. The divisions of the dial being established according to the diameter of the vehicle-wheel and the intermediate wheels between this vehicle-wheel and the wheel (Z, driving the index-finger, the speed at which the vehicle is traveling is at once obtained by observing the division of the dial at which the index-finger stops.  \n  It is obvious that the wheel (Z, which drives the index-finger, could\u0026#39;be driven from one of the vehicle-wheels in any other suitable manner and that the dial could be divided otherwise than as shown, providing the divisions be always equal, the ratio between. the vehicle-wheel driving the ap \u0026#39;)aratus and. the wheel a operating the apparatus being chosen in each case according to the kind of divisions on the dial. The unit of length for the road traversed by the vehicle may be an English mile, a kilometer, or the like. The duration of the working of the cloclnvork may be other than fifteen seconds, as hereinbefore described. The ratio between the movement of the index-finger and the driving-wheel being arranged accordingly, and the mechanism belore described for starting the clockwork, as well as that of the index finger, may be diflerent from that shown. Means may be provided for automatically starting the clockwork by the motion of the vehicle instead of by the push it in the ar rangement shown.  \n  This apparatus may be of about the size of a watch of average size and be inclosed in a casing having the appearance of an ordinary watch and may be carried on a suitable bracket fixed 011 the vehicle-for instance,  \n on the steering-handle of a bicycle or other vehicle.  \n  The apparatus may be made of a larger size for use with (for example) motor-cars, locomotives, or the like.  \n I claim as my invention 1.

Fig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. 1 with one of the bearing-plates and part of the mechanism removed to show more clearly the clockwork stop mechanism. Fig. 3 is a section on the line A B, Fig. 1, viewed in the direction of the arrow C; and Fig. 4 is a face view of the apparatus drawn to a smaller scale, showing the dial and index-finger at zero. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e a is a pinion mounted on a spindle which may be rotated by any suitable meansfor instance, by a flexible member, such as a small metallic endless cablefrom one of the wheels of the vehicle. The inion 0. gears with a wheel I), which is loosei y mounted on the spindle 19 and continually rotates in a contra-clockwise direction. Having one of its sides in frictional engagement with this wheel I) is a ratchet-wheel c, which is fast on the spindle 19 and rotates only when released, as hereinafter more fully described. This spindle 19 also carries the index-pointer 18, which revolves with the ratchet-wheel c. This pointer 18 when released rotates only a predetermined period of time and indicates on the dial 20 a speed proportional to the average speed of the vehicle for that timethat is, the pointer would indicate on the dial in the predetermined time (fifteen seconds in this case) the number of miles per hour at which the vehicle was traveling at that time. A smaller pinion d is also fast to the spindle 19 and gears with a toothed sector e, pivoted at f to the bearing-plate 1 and having a heel or flat part g, against which a pin or projection h is caused to act. The pin his attached to one end of alever pivoted at j to the bearing-plate 21. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Pressure may be exerted in the direction of the arrow Z on the lever t by means of a ,push it to cause the other end m of this lever to move in the direction of the arrow n and come into contact with a pin or stud 0 on the shorter arm 1) of a bent lever q, pivoted at r to the plate 21 and terminating at the upper end of the longer arm in a finger s, which is constantly urged by a spring t to enter one of the four notches u, provided in the periphery of a disk 12, integral with and mounted on the same spindle as a wheel 90 and a pinion y. spring 2 presses against the lever t in a direc tion opposite to that of the arrow 1. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e On the plate 1 is pivoted at 2 an arm 3, connected with the lever q by means of a pin 4, attached to the said lever q. The pin 4 projects through an opening in the plate 1 and engages with a notch 5, provided in the top of the arm 3. The arm 3 is provided at the top with a nose or projection 6, capable of engaging with the teeth of the ratchet-wheel c. The arm q is provided with a shoulder 7, to which is fixed a thin blade-spring 8, Fig. 2, with which a pin or stud 9 on the balancewheel 10 of the clockwork can come into contact to stop the clock. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The scape-wheel 11 is operated from a spring-barrel 12 through a train of wheels 13, 14, 15, 16 y as and 17, 17, being a pinion on the same arbor as and integral with the scapewheel 11. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The diameter of the vehicle-wheel which drives the pinion a being known, the ratio of the wheel-gearing is calculated according to the divisions on the dial. The spring-barrel 12 being wound up and the index-finger 18 stationary at any division of the dial, the working of the apparatus is as follows: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e So long as no pressure is exerted on the push k the wheel I), which is operated by the pinion a, rotates on the arbor 19, the clockworkbeing held stationary, first, by the bladespring 8 bearing against the pin or stud 9 on the balance-wheel 10; secondly, by the nose or projection 6 of the lever g engaging the teeth of the ratchet-wheel c, and, lastly, by the finger s on the arm 3 engaging one oi the four notches u of the disk 1). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e If it be desired to ascertain the speed at which the vehicle fitted with the apparatus is running, the push 7c is pressed in the direction of the arrow Z. The sector a then under the action of the pin or projection h rotates the pinion d, and with it the arbor 19 and index-finger 18, bringing the said index-finger to position of zero on the dial, as shown in Fig. 4. At the same time the lower end m of the lever i, acting on the pin or stud 0, causes the bent lever g and arm 3 to move and disengage the nose 6 from the teeth of the wheel 6, the fingers s from the notch u in the disk t, which is controlled by the clock mechanism, to receive one complete revolution in a min ute, and remove the spring 8 away from the stud 9 on the balance-wheel, so that the clockwork is at once set in motion, whereby the index-:Fmge'r 18 is driven by the pinion a and the wheel I), which is in frictional engagement with the ratchet-wheel (2, until a notch u in the disk 1) is again engaged by the finger s. The push 7c is released as soon as the indexfinger 18 comes to the zero position on the dial, whereupon the lever t returns to its original position, and under the action of the spring 25 the finger s of the arm 3 bearson the disk 0, but without being able to enter the notch u, because the disk has in the meantime been set in motion by the clockwork. The finger s will therefore remain in contact with the periphery of the disk 1) and keep the nose 6 at a slight distance from the teeth of the ratchet-wheel c and the blade-spring 8 out of the path described by the pin or stud 9 on the balance-wheel until the disk v has made a quarter of a rotation, which occupies exactly fifteen seconds, when the next notch u in the periphery of the disk will be opposite the finger s, which finger will enter therein, and the nose 6 on the lever Q will engage with one of the teeth of the wheel 0 and immediately stop the index-linger 18 and the blade-sprin g 8, at the same time coming into the path of the pin or stud 9 on the balance-wheel and stop the clock. During the fifteen seconds the clockwork was working the index-finger 18 will have moved over the dial 20 to an extent proportional to the speed at which the vehicle is running. The divisions of the dial being established according to the diameter of the vehicle-wheel and the intermediate wheels between this vehicle-wheel and the wheel (Z, driving the index-finger, the speed at which the vehicle is traveling is at once obtained by observing the division of the dial at which the index-finger stops. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e It is obvious that the wheel (Z, which drives the index-finger, could'be driven from one of the vehicle-wheels in any other suitable manner and that the dial could be divided otherwise than as shown, providing the divisions be always equal, the ratio between. the vehicle-wheel driving the ap ')aratus and. the wheel a operating the apparatus being chosen in each case according to the kind of divisions on the dial.

Serial No. 258,116.  \n To all, whom it may concern:  \n Be it known that I, CORNELIS HENDRIK JOHAN vAN HAEFTEN, a subj ect of the Queen ot the Netherlands, residing at Oude Scheveningscheweg 5, The Haguefletherlands, have invented a new and useful Process of Producing Manure from eat; and I do herebydeclare the following to a full,- clear, and exact\u0026#39;description of the same.  \n  This invention relates to the treatment of peat, especially for the production of a manure, and has for its object the rapid and economical treatment of peat;  \n  I aim to bring into solution all parts of humus and other ingredients present in peat and soluble in water, including combinations of nitrogen, potash, and phosphorus, which are of great value for the nutrition of plants.  \n  It is well known that water when used alone acts slowly upon the humus constituents in the peat, and in order to hasten the action of the water I mix ammonia therewith. As a resultI the humus constituents are dissolved as well as other ingredients soluble in ammonia, but insolublein water. By the employment of ammoniaas the valuable manure materials \u0026#39;are uick y extracted from the peatV and in a high y-concentrated condition.  \n  My present invention also includes the reuse of the ammonia.  \n  While I may use any suitable apparatus for treating leat according to my invention, in order to ma e its soluble ingredients more free the apparatus preferred and illustrated in the accompanying drawing is somewhat like a diffusion-battery and comprises a plurality of closed vessels connected together for lixiviation of peat with water containing ammonia.4 Such preferred apparatus is more fully described and is claimed in a companion application, Serial No. 258,115, filed April 29, 1905, for Letters Patent of the United States.  \n  In practicing my new process the ammonia is liberated in the form of gas from a solution and flowing through the apparatus dissolved in or admixed with water. Two ressolution of ammonia and the second reservoir containing water. The reservoirs (either or both) may be cooled or heated, as required. An air pump with its pipe connections serves to create a circulation of air from the water-reservoir, through the ammonia-reser- Avoir, and through the battery. The moving air carries ammonia with it and part remains in the vessels. .The main \u0026#39;quantity is, however, taken up by the water in the reservoir, which may be maintained at a low temperature. If after a given time it is found that the ammonia has all passed over into the water or the latter is saturated with ammonia, the ammonia may be reconduct-ed tc the proper reservoir.4 It is obvious, therefore, that the ammonia may be continuously circulated or reused, as desired, without loss.  \n  In carrying out my new process in the manner preferred by me ground peat (G P in the drawing) mixed with water is filled into one or more vessels (two vessels a and p are shown for this purpose in the drawing) to any extent desired. The peat will preferably andhpreyious to being placed in the vessels be washed with dilute ip riatic acid for the purpose of dissolving lime and then washed with water to -{iiove the traces of the muriatic acid. The practice of the method will also be facilitated by the employment of two reservoirs, one, l), contain- .ing ammonia in solution and the other, c, containing water, and the reservoirs and vessels are arranged so that circulating air will first pass through the ammonia solution, then through the mixture of water and ground peat, and then through water in the gef several vessels, and, as shown in drawing, y  \n pipes also connect said reservoirs together in series and with an air-pump e. The vessels, especially a and p, may be surrounded with jackets g, and coiled pipes or other cooling or heated devices connected with suitable sup 1y means are iitted between the jackets an the exterior of the affected vessel. The  \n vessels a and p are provided with all necessary accessories, such as filling ports, dlscharge-doors, manometer, thermometer, sight-glasses, manholes, \u0026amp;c. I have shown the vessels also provided with ports k to permit the introduction of an aerometer to measure the density of the solution. The density may also be measured by drawin a small part of the solution through a suitale discharge-cock- Ammonia solution is filled into the reservoir b, and clean water is filled into the reser- Voir c. the reservoir c may be cooled.  \n  Assuming that the cocks m are opened and the cocks n and o are closed, the pump c is set at work. The air will then circulate, as indicated by solid arrows, through the pipe d upwardly through the ammonia solution, thence upwardly through the peat and water in vessel a, thence u wardly through the peat and water in vesse p, and finally u wardly through the water in reservoir c, bac to the pump e. The cited action of the pump causes rarefication of air in reservoir c and increased pressure in reservoir b. Ammoniagas liberated in the reservoir b (owing to the heating by the surrounding coil) is carried to the circulating air and passing through the peat and water mixtures in vessels a and p causes solution of the soluble peat ingredients. A part of the ammonia-gas mixes, of course, wlth the liquids in the vessels a and p, but the remainder passes over into the water in vessel c, where it passes into solution. When all of the ammonia-gas is extracted from and taken up by the liquids in the vessels a and p and in the reservoir c, the ammonia may be separated from such liquids in any suitable manner by agitation, blowing, or otherwise. The result sought may be easily and quickly effected with the apparatus illustrated by reversing the circulation through the apparatus in the direction indi cated by the dotted arrows. For this purpose the tops of the vessels a and p may be connected directly with the bottom of the air pump by locking other connections and openlng successively the cocks o and the cocks m and n, as well as the cocks which connect the pump with the pipe d, extending downwardly into the reservoir c, and the cock n, which opens from the top of the reservoir b. A circulation of the air, as indicated by the dotted arrows, will therefore bring the ammonia back to the reservoir b. During this o eration the vessels a and p may be heated) to facilitate the exhaustion ofthe ammonia. When all ammonia has been re- The reservoir b may be heated and leased in this manner from the water and peat mixtures, the cocks fn, and o are closed, while the cocks lml are opened. The reservoir c is then heated, inasmuch as the tem erature of the outside air requires this, and t e reser- Voir b is cooled. As a result when the airpump is operated there is a rapid circulation 1n the direction of the dotted arrows. When the desired density of the solution in the vessels a, and p has reached a sufiicient degree to be measured by the insertion of an aerometer, the weighted doors of such vessels are opened, and the contents are emptied after being freed of ammonia, as described.  \n The discharged material maybe dried and s read on the soil in powdered form and used a one or in mixture with other manure.  \n  Among the advantages due to employing my process I may mention the fact that n0 ammonia-gas is lost, but that a Singlesllpply of such gas may be reutilized as often as desired, forasmuch as it is not in combination with the hurnic acid of the peat.  \n  If desired, the process may be carried out without employing a body of water separate from the ammonia solution. In such event the ammonia-gas may bepumped through the mixture of ground peat and water, and when the latter is fully saturated with ammonia or all of the ammonia is removed from the ammonia solution the mixture of peat and water is subjected to a suction or agita,- tion to remove theammonia and return it to the ammonia solution. Heat may be availed of to facilitate such exhaustion.  \n What I claim is- 1. The process for production of manure from peat, consisting in mixing ground peat with water, and circulating ammonia-gas through such mixture.  \n  2. The process for production of manure from peat, consisting 1n mixing ground peat with water, circulating ammonia-gas through such mixture, and then circulating air through the mixture to drive off the ammonia.  \n  3. The process for production of manure from peat, consisting 1n mixing ground peat with water, mixing ammonia-gas therewith, and subjecting the mass to suction to recover the ammonia.  \n  In testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \n CORNELIS HENDRIK JOHAN VAN HAEFTEN.  \n Witnesses:  \n I.

CROMWELL, OF CLEVELAND, OHIO, ASSIGNOR TO THE GARRETT- CROMWELL ENGINEERING COMPANY, OF CLEVELAND, OHIO, A COR- PORATION OF OHIO.  \n TILTING FURNACE.  \n - Specification of Letters Patent.  \n Patented June 19, 1906.  \n \u0026#39; Application filed April 9, 1906. Serial 0. 310,624.  \n h State of Ohio, have invented a certain new and useful Improvement in Tilting Furnaces,  \n  of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.  \n The object of the present invention is to provide an improved construction for tilting furnaces, which is es ecially applicable to furnaces of the openearth type, which receive their as and air supply from the ends, but  \n  it is a so of utility in connection with any tilting1 metallurgical furnace which -is designe to hold large masses of material and v iigh temperature.  \n The problem of mounting tiltin metallurgical furnaces has been approache from sev- 2o eral sides and various solutions have been 2 5 One of the most familiar types of tiltin furnace is that which is provided with a curve 7 bearin at each end of the bottom of the furnace, t 1e bearing being curved on a radius drawn from a point about the center of the The furnace is supported by a curvature of the furnace-bearing, so that the tipping of the furnace would be accomplished 3 5 by causing it to rotate upon the said rollers.  \n This style of furnace is exceedingly defective by reason of the fact that the curvature of the base constantly changes owing ,to the expansion caused by the heat, with the result 0 that the furnace-bearings will be at times supported by only two of the rollers and the weight and strains thus concentrated at points of the furnace and supporting-base, which were not contemplated in the original 5 design. Subsequent to the use of this type there was adopted a floating cradle composed of \u0026#39;a series of rollers held together by curved rails in which they are journaled interposed between the curved bottom of the furnace 5e and the curved top of the supportingfounda-\u0026#39; This type of support is also subject to the above-described trouble, arising from ex-I tion.  \n pansion of the furnace when heated, in that the furnace bearing is altered,\u0026#39;and therefore concentrates its load upon only a few of the rollers of the floating cradle, thus distribut ing the strains along lines which cannot be properl allowed for in advance. Furthermore, t ese cradles are intendedto slip and slide between the furnace and the sup orting-foundation, but do not always m\u0026#39;ove ack and forth \u0026#39;to the same extent, with the result that one is sometimes so far ahead of the other in its relative position that the one end of the furnace has to be jacked up, while the cradles are replaced in alinement with each other. A third old type of furnace known in the art is mounted on a supportin -frame beneath the base of the furnace, w \u0026#39;ch frame has curvedl\u0026#39;oekers at each end, each rotatin on a pair of rollers journaled in a horizonta line on the top of a flat supporti -base. The ends of the\u0026#39;curved rockers exten considerably beyond the bottom of the furnace in order to allow for the pro er rotation, but such extensions are, as will e obvious, subjected to a eat brea strain when the furnace is tilted, so that the load is thrown thereon. Furthermore, these projections are quite awkward, being obviously in the way. Still another type of furnace is the type which rolls forward as it tilts and which, as distinguished from those previously mentioned, is provided with a curved base resting directly upon a horizontal foundation upon which it rolls back and forth, thus causing the entire furnace to move forward as it is tllted. This type is particularly objectionable by reason of it being necessary to roll it so far forward when the material is low that the gas-ports will pass entirely out of register with the conduit leading from the regenerator and even raised to the points where cold air from the outside rushes in and chills the furnace. Obviously no combustion can take place under these conditions. The manner in which I have mounted my tilting furnace is possessed of all of the advantages of the first three types which rotate about a definite center and is also possessed of the advantages of the last type in that there is no variation or shifting in the strains during use.  \n 1 Referring to the accompanying drawings,  \n .fFigure 1 is a section, partly diagrammatic, taken about midwa of the furnace looking toward one end, as a ong line 1 1, Fig. 2. Fig.  \n 2 represents a longitudinal section of one end of the furnace, showing certain parts in elevation. Fig. 3 is a detail of a bearing-Wheel mounted upon the trackway. Fig. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 2 of a modified support.  \n  The furnace A is of the usual construction of the open-hearth type, having communication with the gas and air ports B B, leading from the regenerators, and is mounted upon a framework of girders O, suitably designed and proportioned to withstand the supporting strains in all positions inwhich the furnace ma be tilted. The girder-frame has at each en supporting-brackets C\u0026#34;, in which are journaled rollers 0 adapted to ride upon the curved trackway D of the supporting-foundation. The curvature of this trackway is that of a circle having its centerabout the as and air ports aforesaid. It will be noted t f at this trackway has, beside the bearing or rolling surface upon which the su portin -rollers move, also. a se mental rac D 0 pro or length desi ned or use in connection with a motor mecanisrn upon the end of the furnace for the pur ose of tilting the same. The motor employe for this purpose is of any suitable type, but preferab y electric, and is swung in any convenient manner. I have shown the driving connection as that of a worm shaft E and Wheel E transmittin power from the motor E to gears, E E Whic .1: turn tran mit the power to, a cog E, meshing with the segmen al rack D before mentioned. This reduction device is very efficient for the purpose intended,.and the furnace is under absolutely perfect, and positive control in all positions. This furnace may obr.i\u0026#39;ously be rotated. about a given axis, which be thel-ine, assing-through the centers of curvature of t or two, supporting-rails, and it is, so designed that the shifting of the bath upon tilting will not disturb the state of stable equilibrium, the center of ravity being close to the axis of rotationl uring rotation the fuel-ports will not be exposed to the cold air, an. combustion may be continued at all ositions of\u0026#39;the furnace. It will be further no ed that no matter how the furnace may expand under the influence of heat the supporting-frame upon which it is mounted will alwa s, receive the thrusts along exactly the sameb\u0026#39;nes, so that the original design will be effective and not disclose weakness. under the changed conditions.  \n In conformance with the principle above set forth I have produced a modifie support ing structure, differing as to certain s ecific details,,whichls illustrated in Fi .4. n this form I have journaled short equa ing-beams. F instead of bearing-Wheels in the ends of\u0026#39; the furnace-frame C and have journaled wheels F\u0026#34; in each end of the saidbeams. Each beam and its Wheels. go to make up a single support which as a unit is j ournale in the end of the frame. It will be plain that the same principle obtains in this structure which is embodied in the form first described, since the expansion of the furnace due to heat will not alter the points of hearing or direction of thrust in any manner, and the frame will always hear the load exactly as it was designed to do. An advantage of this modified structure lies in the fact that a greater number of bearin -wheels may be employed, and, in the case of the exceedin ly large furnaces which I am enabled to procIuce from the broad principle of construction previously outlined, this is a matter of reat importance, since the crushin effect is d istributed among the several whee s which go to make up the individual supports. I have thus, owing to the maintenance of the conditions for which the furnace was designed, been enabled to construct furnaces of great dimensions with absolute certainty that they will hold together at all points in all positions. It is thought that with the combination of these advantages in one structure the problem of constructin heavy tilting furnaces has been satisfactori y solved in a manner which will permit of practically unlimited expansion in the way of an increase in size of open-hearth furnaces, which is in the present condition of the art of the greatest moment.  \n  Having thus. described my invention, I claim 1. In combination, a tilting metallurgical furnace havin a frame, a curved supportingtrackway for t he furnace, each end of the furnace having journaled therein two supports which bear on said trackway.  \n  2. In combination, a furnace adapted to rotate about a given axis having a frame hav ing two supports journaled at each end, a supporting-base having a fixed curved runway upon which said supports bear, and motor mechanism mounted on the furnace and adapted to rotate the same.  \n  3. In combination, a tilting metallurgical furnace havin a frame, a curved supportingtrackway for t e furnace, each end of the furnace having j\u0026#39;ournaled therein two equalizingbeams which have two rollers journaled thereon and bearing on the trackway.  \n  4. In combination, a tilting furnace, a curved trackway for the furnace, each end of the furnace having supports mounted thereon and riding upon said trackway in such manner as to be independent in their supporting function of the expansion of the furnace.  \n  In testimony whereof I hereunto affix my signature in the presence of two witnesses.  \n JOHN C.

Serial 0. 310,624. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eh State of Ohio, have invented a certain new and useful Improvement in Tilting Furnaces, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe object of the present invention is to provide an improved construction for tilting furnaces, which is es ecially applicable to furnaces of the openearth type, which receive their as and air supply from the ends, but \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e it is a so of utility in connection with any tilting1 metallurgical furnace which -is designe to hold large masses of material and v iigh temperature. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem of mounting tiltin metallurgical furnaces has been approache from sev- 2o eral sides and various solutions have been 2 5 One of the most familiar types of tiltin furnace is that which is provided with a curve 7 bearin at each end of the bottom of the furnace, t 1e bearing being curved on a radius drawn from a point about the center of the The furnace is supported by a curvature of the furnace-bearing, so that the tipping of the furnace would be accomplished 3 5 by causing it to rotate upon the said rollers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis style of furnace is exceedingly defective by reason of the fact that the curvature of the base constantly changes owing ,to the expansion caused by the heat, with the result 0 that the furnace-bearings will be at times supported by only two of the rollers and the weight and strains thus concentrated at points of the furnace and supporting-base, which were not contemplated in the original 5 design. Subsequent to the use of this type there was adopted a floating cradle composed of 'a series of rollers held together by curved rails in which they are journaled interposed between the curved bottom of the furnace 5e and the curved top of the supportingfounda-' This type of support is also subject to the above-described trouble, arising from ex-I tion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epansion of the furnace when heated, in that the furnace bearing is altered,'and therefore concentrates its load upon only a few of the rollers of the floating cradle, thus distribut ing the strains along lines which cannot be properl allowed for in advance. Furthermore, t ese cradles are intendedto slip and slide between the furnace and the sup orting-foundation, but do not always m'ove ack and forth 'to the same extent, with the result that one is sometimes so far ahead of the other in its relative position that the one end of the furnace has to be jacked up, while the cradles are replaced in alinement with each other. A third old type of furnace known in the art is mounted on a supportin -frame beneath the base of the furnace, w 'ch frame has curvedl'oekers at each end, each rotatin on a pair of rollers journaled in a horizonta line on the top of a flat supporti -base. The ends of the'curved rockers exten considerably beyond the bottom of the furnace in order to allow for the pro er rotation, but such extensions are, as will e obvious, subjected to a eat brea strain when the furnace is tilted, so that the load is thrown thereon. Furthermore, these projections are quite awkward, being obviously in the way. Still another type of furnace is the type which rolls forward as it tilts and which, as distinguished from those previously mentioned, is provided with a curved base resting directly upon a horizontal foundation upon which it rolls back and forth, thus causing the entire furnace to move forward as it is tllted. This type is particularly objectionable by reason of it being necessary to roll it so far forward when the material is low that the gas-ports will pass entirely out of register with the conduit leading from the regenerator and even raised to the points where cold air from the outside rushes in and chills the furnace. Obviously no combustion can take place under these conditions. The manner in which I have mounted my tilting furnace is possessed of all of the advantages of the first three types which rotate about a definite center and is also possessed of the advantages of the last type in that there is no variation or shifting in the strains during use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1 Referring to the accompanying drawings, \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.fFigure 1 is a section, partly diagrammatic, taken about midwa of the furnace looking toward one end, as a ong line 1 1, Fig. 2. Fig. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2 represents a longitudinal section of one end of the furnace, showing certain parts in elevation. Fig. 3 is a detail of a bearing-Wheel mounted upon the trackway. Fig. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 2 of a modified support. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The furnace A is of the usual construction of the open-hearth type, having communication with the gas and air ports B B, leading from the regenerators, and is mounted upon a framework of girders O, suitably designed and proportioned to withstand the supporting strains in all positions inwhich the furnace ma be tilted. The girder-frame has at each en supporting-brackets C\", in which are journaled rollers 0 adapted to ride upon the curved trackway D of the supporting-foundation. The curvature of this trackway is that of a circle having its centerabout the as and air ports aforesaid. It will be noted t f at this trackway has, beside the bearing or rolling surface upon which the su portin -rollers move, also. a se mental rac D 0 pro or length desi ned or use in connection with a motor mecanisrn upon the end of the furnace for the pur ose of tilting the same. The motor employe for this purpose is of any suitable type, but preferab y electric, and is swung in any convenient manner. I have shown the driving connection as that of a worm shaft E and Wheel E transmittin power from the motor E to gears, E E Whic .1: turn tran mit the power to, a cog E, meshing with the segmen al rack D before mentioned. This reduction device is very efficient for the purpose intended,.and the furnace is under absolutely perfect, and positive control in all positions. This furnace may obr.i'ously be rotated. about a given axis, which be thel-ine, assing-through the centers of curvature of t or two, supporting-rails, and it is, so designed that the shifting of the bath upon tilting will not disturb the state of stable equilibrium, the center of ravity being close to the axis of rotationl uring rotation the fuel-ports will not be exposed to the cold air, an. combustion may be continued at all ositions of'the furnace. It will be further no ed that no matter how the furnace may expand under the influence of heat the supporting-frame upon which it is mounted will alwa s, receive the thrusts along exactly the sameb'nes, so that the original design will be effective and not disclose weakness. under the changed conditions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conformance with the principle above set forth I have produced a modifie support ing structure, differing as to certain s ecific details,,whichls illustrated in Fi .4. n this form I have journaled short equa ing-beams. F instead of bearing-Wheels in the ends of' the furnace-frame C and have journaled wheels F\" in each end of the saidbeams. Each beam and its Wheels. go to make up a single support which as a unit is j ournale in the end of the frame. It will be plain that the same principle obtains in this structure which is embodied in the form first described, since the expansion of the furnace due to heat will not alter the points of hearing or direction of thrust in any manner, and the frame will always hear the load exactly as it was designed to do. An advantage of this modified structure lies in the fact that a greater number of bearin -wheels may be employed, and, in the case of the exceedin ly large furnaces which I am enabled to procIuce from the broad principle of construction previously outlined, this is a matter of reat importance, since the crushin effect is d istributed among the several whee s which go to make up the individual supports. I have thus, owing to the maintenance of the conditions for which the furnace was designed, been enabled to construct furnaces of great dimensions with absolute certainty that they will hold together at all points in all positions. It is thought that with the combination of these advantages in one structure the problem of constructin heavy tilting furnaces has been satisfactori y solved in a manner which will permit of practically unlimited expansion in the way of an increase in size of open-hearth furnaces, which is in the present condition of the art of the greatest moment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus. described my invention, I claim 1. In combination, a tilting metallurgical furnace havin a frame, a curved supportingtrackway for t he furnace, each end of the furnace having journaled therein two supports which bear on said trackway. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 2.

BEAUREGARD, of Kingsbury, in the county of Washington, in the State of New York,have invented a new and improved Heep-Lock; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, which will enable others skilled in the art to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this specication.  \n  This invention relates to an improved hasp-lock, whereby greater simplicity and security are obtained than are afforded by the hasp-locks heretofore in use. n  \n  It consists mainly in the eontrivances for locking the bolt when shot into the staple, andv which cannot then be unlocked, even with the proper key, without first performing an independent operation, which consists in thrusting the bolt yet further forward in a direction opposite to that `in which. it must be moved to release thehasp. i I  \n In the accompanying drawings- Figure l is a front view of my improved hasp-lock, showing the same boltedLa-nd A Figure 2 is a detail view thereof, showing the hasp bolted but not locked, the dotted lines showing theA position of the parts when thebolt is locked and thrust forward to enable it to be unlocked,  \n  Figure 3 is an isometrical view of the key, which I prefer to use to lock and unlock the\u0026#39;bolt, though any other form of key might be used. I I  \n Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding parts.  \n  B is the hasp, which I prefer making of wrought iron, and which is provided with a circular extension or plate, B B\u0026#39;, which forms\u0026#39;the bottom plate for the reception and attachment of the working parts, and forming, with the rim or wall S and top plate T, a. suitable box to contain said working parts A is the bolt, passing through slots S\u0026#34; S S S in the rim or wall S, and is cut out at a a to enable the locking-circle to be received at a\u0026#39;, and so preventing the withdrawal of the bolt.  \n  P and 0 are ears or stops, attached to the upper and under edges of bolt A for the purposes presently described. l  \n l N N N are guides, holding the locking-cirele D in place \u0026#39;to the wall S, N N\u0026#34; serving also as head-blocks for the springs E E and engaging-lever L. I  \n  The locking-circleD carries, on \u0026#39;a portion of its circumference, the internal cog V, which engages in the segmental ratchetwheel C, operated\u0026#39;by the key X, iig. 3, by which the end of the locking-circle is thrown across the shoulder a of the bolt A. Y  \n  W is a tooth, set near the opposite end of the locking-circle; and when the bolt has been shot forward it is made to engage with the tooth Z, operating .the segmental wheel- C With the key, S0 @S t0 thlOW the Dd 0f circle D behind the shoulder a,) and being so engaged, prevents the circle D from being operated by the seg-4 lmental wheel to withdraw the circle D from a\u0026#39;, and vthus prevents the bolt from being unlocked.  \n The spring E, set in the head-blocks N\u0026#39;, presses against the engaging-levrer L, holding it home to the,  \n locking-circle D. The spring E\u0026#39;, set in the head-block N, presses the boltA against the upper portion of the slots S S S S. K,  \n  A handle or knob, H, connects by the pin M, (which works back and forth -in a slot in the top plate vT,) and operates the bolt A. l\u0026#39; The bolt being thrown forward, the key is inserted in the ratchet-wheel C, and turned in the direction of the arrow, throwing the end of the\u0026#39;locking-circle behind the shoulder a\u0026#39;, and drawing\u0026#39; back the tooth W until it passes the end-ot\u0026#39; the tooth Z,.when the spring E, pressing up the engaging-leverL, \u0026#39;the tooth langages in W\u0026#39;,  \n and prevents the end, cl, of locking-circle D from being withdrawn. Y Y  \n To unlock the bolt, an upward and forward\u0026#39;pressure must now be employed at a, whereby the outer end of bolt A is depressed, and the ear P, which, in looking, by striking against the wall\u0026#39; S, prevented the bolt from being shot too far, enters the Slot S\u0026#39;, and the ear O, now striking against said wall, prevents the bolt from being overshot. As the bolt is pushed forward, the pin K moves the arm of lever L into the position shown by the dotted lines, releasing the tooth W, and enabling the end, d, of locking-circle D to be retired from the shoulder a\u0026#39;, by the key operating the ratchet-wheel C, and \u0026#39;the bolt is then withdrawn from the hasp by simply drawing it back by the knob or handle H.  \n  The locking-end ofthe bolt A may be\u0026#39;inade with a semicircular section for readiness of adjustment to any kind of stapleY The key-hole Q may be cut in top plate T in a position different from that in which the key has to be inserted in thc wheel C, so as to render it necessary to be turned; beneath the plate T, and increase the diiculty of unlocking the bolt on the part of a person unacquaintcd with the mechanism. l  \n  A thumb-piece or button, R, may also be inserted on the end of bolt A, and Works in slot S\u0026#39;\u0026#34; as a blind to persons tampering with the lock, as they would be sure to press on the thumb-piece or button, under the notion that it must have something:r to do with enabling the bolt to be unlocked.  \n  The top plate T and rim or Wall S may be cast in one piece, and the working parts being attached in place on thewroughtiron bottom plate B\u0026#39;, the top plate and Wall may then be-secured over them upon the bottom plate B. Y l  \n  Another great advantage which my improved hasp-lock presents is, that water can rarely get inside to rust the Working part-s, as generally happens in locks attached to out-buildings; while if the lock be attached hanging downwards, and water should at any time get in, it will run out at the slot S in rim or wall S.  \n  When\u0026#39;the lock is set horizontally, a small hole or slot-may be pierced in the lower portion of the Wall or rim S to\u0026#39;effect the same object.  \n  It will be seen that when the boltA is unlocked, it is drawn back and forth at pleasure, and serves, as any common hasp or bolt, to keep the door\u0026#39;to.  \n Having thus described my invention, what IY claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-  \n  l. The locking-circle, constructed with the internal cog V and the tooth W, in combination with bolt A and lever L, substantially as and for the purpose described.  \n  2. The bolt A, fastened substantially as described, and provided with the ears or stops O P, as and for the purposes substantially as described.  \n  3. The pivoted engaging-lever L, with tooth Z, in combination with the locking-circle D, pin M, and bolt A, substantially as and for the purpose described.  \n The above specification signed by me, this`eleventh day of March, 1868.  \n , J.

Serial No. 254.886-  \n To (LZZ whom, it 777/6by concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, EMILE GIRAUD, engineer, a citizen of the French Republic, residing at Paris, France, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Safety Devices for Overhead Electric Conductors, of which the following is a specification.  \n  This invention has for its object to provide means whereby in case of a high-voltage overhead conductor breaking the same is connected to earth or short-circuited by another conductor in its vicinity.  \n In the accompanying drawings, Figures 1 2, and 3 represent in elevation, side view, and plan, respectively, a safety arrangement constructed according to this invention; Fig. 4, a side view, and Fig. 5 a section, of a modification of a detail. Fig. 6 shows the line in its normal state, and Fig. 7 shows the line with the conductor 6 broken.  \n  Referring to Figs. 1, 2, and 3, in the groove formed in the head of the insulator b is placed a trough-shaped metal piece a for the reception of the conductor 6, the said metal piece a having two extensions 0 and 0, provided with pins d and cl. The conductor e, laid in the trough a, can slide therein. On the pins (1 d are pivoted two forked piecesff, which bear on the conductor 6, each fork-piece carrying a light and rigid extension g, consisting of a tube preferably of aluminium and terminating in or carrying at its end and at right angles thereto a tube h h of U-shape or bent to the shape of an are. On the conductor 6 are fixedly mounted rings t i, having upwardly-extending members and j which, in the event of the conductor breaking, the consequent traction exerted on the portion of the conductor that is not broken is caused to bring either of said members 7\u0026#39; and j to bear against the forked pieces f or f, as the case may be. These forks under the pull exerted by the sleeves i or i, having the members and j are tilted, thereby causing the part It or it of the arm 9 or g to come in contact with one of the other conductors arranged in the vicinity of the first conductor.  \n  It will be observed in Figs. 6 and 7 that there are two conductors e and e. For the conductor a the safety devices are disposed for coming into contact with the conductor a if the conductor ebreaks. For the conductor e the safety devices are disposed for coming into contact with the conductor 6 if the conductor 6 breaks. a is the dynamo,  \n \u0026#39; and 0 a circuit-breaker which cuts out the current when a short circuit is between the two conductors.  \n  In the case of a single conductor the same arrangement permits of connecting the conductor to earth.  \n  To the rings 2\u0026#39; and t\u0026#34; are pivoted forksj and j, embracing the extensions 9 g. These forks are intended to engage and support the arms 9 and g and also to prevent said arms 9 and g from tilting too far in an upward direction, when, as would be the case in certain stablished position, gravity would tend to bring the arms 9 and g away from the conductor.  \n  This apparatus need not be provided on all the posts of the line, as it will suffice to provide it on every second or third post, the intermediate posts being provided with simply trough-shaped pieces fixed to the top of the insulator to carry the conductor 6.  \n  The troughshaped piece a, carrying the pins d (1, may be constructed in various manners. It may, for instance, be cast in one piece with the extensions 0 c and with the arms it by which it is fixed to the insulator b. It is necessary in this case to have as many patterns as there are types of insulators and arrangements of the conductors one relatively to the other.  \n  The trough-shaped member may be constructed as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. It consists of a central tubular member a with two fastening-arms 7c 7c. The tubular member a, is provided at each end with fiutings, in which collars m, provided with projections corresponding to the fiutings, may be fixed in variable directions. The pins (1 are car ried by the collars m. This modified arrangement requires as many patterns as there are types of insulators.  \n  Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of my said invention and in what manner the same is to be performed, I declare that what I claim is 1. In a safety device for overhead electric conductors, an insulator having a groove, a trough-shaped metal piece mounted in the groove for supporting the conductor, a jointed fork arranged on each side of the trough and embracing the conductor and terminating in an arm, a U-shaped piece supported by the latter, a ring fixed to the conductor on each side of the insulator and beyond the forks and having a diameter sufficient to prevent the said rings passing between the branches of the corresponding fork, substantially as described.  \n  2. In a safety device, an insulator, a troughshaped member formed of a single piece mounted in said insulator and having extensions, forks carried by the extensions and having branch arms for engagement With the conductors, substantially as described.  \n  3. In a safety device of the class described, an insulator, a trough-shaped member supported by said insulator for receiving the conductor, extensions on said member, forks having arms pivotally connected to said extensions, and means carried by the conductor for actuating the arms, substantially as described.  \n  4.

F1g. 2, represents a section through the red line :22, w, of Fig. 1. Fig. 3, represents one of the drop plugs, for closing the openings in the top of the twyer, when the whole blast 1s not required. Fig. t represents one of the bolts for securing the top plate to the bottom of the twyer, and Fig. 5, the handle for operating the slide on the bottom of the twyer.  \n  Similar letters in the several figures represent the same parts.  \n  The nature of my invention consists in the arrangement of the inner and outer beads on the top plate, between which is placed clay or other plastic materlal, and the grooves in the edges of the s des of the twyer, for the purpose of making an a1r tight joint, the whole being secured by bolts with projections upon them catching over a cam, cast on the flanges on the under plate.  \n  To enable others skilled in the art to make and use my invention, I will proceed to describe the same with reference to the draw- The body of the twyer A, is cast in a square box-shaped form, and the bottom B, thereof, has its sides so inclined toward each other as to form a hopper into which the dust, ashes, slag \u0026amp;c., falling through the blast openings will collect. Through the bottom of this hopper, is an opening a, which has its sides beveled from the inside to the outside thereof, leaving on the outside a sharp edge, and over said opening, on the outside of the twyer is a slide 0, which has its edge beveled off from the outside to the inside, so as to form with the beveled edge of the opening a, shears for cutting oft the slag which passes through the twyer after a heavy blast, and allows said slide to make with the bottom of the twyer an air tight joint. The slide C, is secured at its rear end by a bolt or rivet D, upon which it may swing, and secured to the slide by the same rivet is a spring Z), which projects to nearly the front of the slide, and holds it firmly, up against the bottom of the twyer. The sides of the twyer are vertical, and on the top edge of said sides are cut-the grooves o, for a purpose which will be hereafter described.  \n On the bottom plate B, are cast flanges E,  \n through the holes (Z, in which pass bolts,-  \n which secures the twyer in its bed on the hearth. There are also through said flanges holes which have a slot f, which are cut through the bottom plate meeting them, for the purpose of passing through said holes, and slot, the bolt F, and its projection or arm 9, and on the underside of said flanges E, and around the holes is cast a can1,over which the arm 9\u0026#34;, of the bolt catches, and draws down firmly the top plate (to be hereafter described) so as to make a close joint.  \n  The funnel G, of the twyer, which is cast with the main body thereof, has a slight inclination upward, so as to be adapted to the nozzle of an ordinary bellows, which has a similar inclination in a contrary direction, and which allows the twyer to lie perfect-1y level on the hearth.  \n  The top plate of the twyer is cast separate, and has upon its four sides the lugs H, through which are slotted holes h, similar to, and so arranged as that any two of them will stand directly over the holes in the flange on the bottom, and through said holes and slots pass the bolts and their arms or projections 9, before described, said arms catching over the cams on the bottom plate, and by turning said bolts the top and bottom parts are drawn firmly together. These bolts are found to be a much better fastening than screw bolts, or keyed-bolts, for the latter by the action of the fire becomes so cemented as to make them very difficult to be removed. By making the twyer square, the top plate can be turned, so as to bring the blast openings into convenient position for making a long or broad heat, as may be desirable.  \n  On the underside of the top plate are double beads or projections 2\u0026#39;, between which the sides of the body of the twyer come, and between which beads, when the twyer is to be put together is placed clay or other material, so that when the top and bottom of the twyer is drawn closely together by the bolts F, the clay will fill up the groove 0, in  \n the top of the sides, and the space\u0026#39;between the beads 2\u0026#39;, and the sides of the twyer, so as to make an air tight connection.  \n  011 top of the twyer is an elevation I, which is divided by three wedge-shaped partitions J, and which forms the conical chambers K, through the holes j, in which the blast issues. The sides is, of the conical chambers K, project downward below the general line of the top of the twyer, so as to present a larger opening in the interior, for the purpose of taking in a larger body of air, and as the chamber K, gradually diminishes toward the exit j, the blast is contracted and issues with greater force. The spaces 5, between the openings 7\u0026#39;, in the top of the t-wyer are grooved out so as to allow the dust, ashes \u0026amp;c., to slide off from said openings, instead of falling into the interior of the twyer.  \n  L, Fig. 3, represent drop plugs which may be inserted from the outside into the openings 3\u0026#39;, when the whole blast is not required for instance in heating light work. These drop plugs are provided with a flange m, so as to catch over the tops of the openings aforesaid, to prevent the plugs from falling through, and to stop any air from issuing through said openings.  \n  On the slide G, underneath, is cast a double headed lug a, over which is placed an opening 0, in the end of the handle M, Fig. 5, for the purpose of moving the slide to cleanse the twyer, and which may be readily detached when notrequired for that purpose.  \n  Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim therein as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent is The combination of the inner and outer beads on the top plate, between which is placed clay or other plastic material, and  \n the grooves in the edges of the sides of the twyer for the purpose of making an air tight joint, the whole being secured by bolts with a projection upon them catching over a cam cast on flanges on the under plate as herein described and represented.  \n  WM.

There are also through said flanges holes which have a slot f, which are cut through the bottom plate meeting them, for the purpose of passing through said holes, and slot, the bolt F, and its projection or arm 9, and on the underside of said flanges E, and around the holes is cast a can1,over which the arm 9\", of the bolt catches, and draws down firmly the top plate (to be hereafter described) so as to make a close joint. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The funnel G, of the twyer, which is cast with the main body thereof, has a slight inclination upward, so as to be adapted to the nozzle of an ordinary bellows, which has a similar inclination in a contrary direction, and which allows the twyer to lie perfect-1y level on the hearth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The top plate of the twyer is cast separate, and has upon its four sides the lugs H, through which are slotted holes h, similar to, and so arranged as that any two of them will stand directly over the holes in the flange on the bottom, and through said holes and slots pass the bolts and their arms or projections 9, before described, said arms catching over the cams on the bottom plate, and by turning said bolts the top and bottom parts are drawn firmly together. These bolts are found to be a much better fastening than screw bolts, or keyed-bolts, for the latter by the action of the fire becomes so cemented as to make them very difficult to be removed. By making the twyer square, the top plate can be turned, so as to bring the blast openings into convenient position for making a long or broad heat, as may be desirable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e On the underside of the top plate are double beads or projections 2', between which the sides of the body of the twyer come, and between which beads, when the twyer is to be put together is placed clay or other material, so that when the top and bottom of the twyer is drawn closely together by the bolts F, the clay will fill up the groove 0, in \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe top of the sides, and the space'between the beads 2', and the sides of the twyer, so as to make an air tight connection. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 011 top of the twyer is an elevation I, which is divided by three wedge-shaped partitions J, and which forms the conical chambers K, through the holes j, in which the blast issues. The sides is, of the conical chambers K, project downward below the general line of the top of the twyer, so as to present a larger opening in the interior, for the purpose of taking in a larger body of air, and as the chamber K, gradually diminishes toward the exit j, the blast is contracted and issues with greater force. The spaces 5, between the openings 7', in the top of the t-wyer are grooved out so as to allow the dust, ashes \u0026amp;c., to slide off from said openings, instead of falling into the interior of the twyer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e L, Fig. 3, represent drop plugs which may be inserted from the outside into the openings 3', when the whole blast is not required for instance in heating light work. These drop plugs are provided with a flange m, so as to catch over the tops of the openings aforesaid, to prevent the plugs from falling through, and to stop any air from issuing through said openings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e On the slide G, underneath, is cast a double headed lug a, over which is placed an opening 0, in the end of the handle M, Fig. 5, for the purpose of moving the slide to cleanse the twyer, and which may be readily detached when notrequired for that purpose. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim therein as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent is The combination of the inner and outer beads on the top plate, between which is placed clay or other plastic material, and \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe grooves in the edges of the sides of the twyer for the purpose of making an air tight joint, the whole being secured by bolts with a projection upon them catching over a cam cast on flanges on the under plate as herein described and represented. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e WM.

SAFETY-GATE.  \n Specification of Letters Patent.  \n Patented July 24, 1906.  \n Application filed June 8, 1904:. Serial No. 211,636.  \n To all whom, it may concern.-  \n  Be it known that I, ALBURTIs EAGLE, a citizen of the United Newtown, Bucks county, Pennsylvania, have invented certain Improvements in Safety- Gates, of which the following is a specification.  \n  My invention relates to that class of gates or barriers which may be controlled bya pass ing or approaching vehicle, engine, car, or train.  \n  My invention consists of a gate or barrier of this character for railroad-crossings being set in place by suitable mechanism operated by an approaching train from either direction and withdrawn or disposed clear of the crossing by other mechanism operated by the train as it leaves the particular crossing.  \n  The object of my invention is to provide a simple and efficient form of gate or barrier that may be rolled or folded when not in use and to provide simple operating mechanism controlling such movement, which may be readily actuated by the passing train.  \n  ther object of my invention is to provide a gate or barrier with flexible members which while serving as a visual signal and in some instances a positive obstruction to prevent teams crossing the track will be of such a character as to render no injury to an animal should it be accidentally driven against the same, a condition that might readily ocour on double-track roads when a train is passing on the track farthest from an approaching team.  \n  My invention is fully shown in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure l is a front elevation of one form of gate and operating mechanism embodying my invention. Fig. 2 is an elevation of one end of the same. Fig. 3 is a front elevation of anotherform of gate embodying my invention, and Fig. 4 is an enlarged view illustrating a detail of my invention.  \n  In the accompanying drawings, 1 represents the vertical posts, and 2 the cross-beam, of a framework of suitable strength and dimensions, which may be mounted crossings on one or both sides of the track. This frame carries a shaft 3, journaled in suitable bearings 4, carried by the cross-beam 2, and this shaft carries a series of drums 5, which turn therewith, upon which drums are wound weighted bands or tapes 6. In the view herewith these bands are shown in the lowered position, serving as a signal or bar- States, and a resident of at railway rier to prevent persons and teams from crossing the track. On the outer end ofthe shaft 3 a drum 7 is mounted, to which is connected a cord 8, the opposite end of which is attached to the end of the arm 9 of a bell-crank\u0026#39;lever. This lever is pivoted at 10 and carries on its accidental displacement or removal of such weight during the operation of the structure. The weight is suspended from a bar 15, which carries a pulley 16, adapted to travel on the arm 11, and this bar is connected by a link 17 to the arm 18 of a bell-crank lever pivoted at 19. The other arm 20 of this latter bellcrank lever is connected, by means of a link 21, with the arm 22 of a bell-crank lever pivoted at 23 to the lower part of the frame 1, the other arm 24 of which latter bell-crank lever is connected to a cord or wire 25, which extends to any suitable form of resetting or self-setting trip mechanism (which, however, forms no part of my invention) to be actuated by the approaching or passing engine, train, car, or other vehicle. It will be seen, therefore, that if thepassing train actuates the trip mechanism connected to the wire or cord 25 and pulls it in the direction of the arrow 00 the lower bell-crank lever will raise the intermediate bell-crank medium of the link 21, thereby permitting the weight to ride down the arm 11 of the upper bell-crank lever, the latter lowering and causing its arm 9 to unwind the cord 8 on the drum 7. This unwinding of the cord will cause the rotation of the shaft 3 and the rewinding of the weighted tapes or bands, thus raising them from the lowered active position in which they had been placed by the approaching train.  \n  In Fig. 3 I have shown a form of foldin gate which comprises two sections 26 an 26, mounted on either side of the frame supporting the same. The rails 27 I and 27*, forming these sections, may close together in the same manner as lazy-ton s, and for this purpose they are provided wit cross-bars 28 and 28 which are pivoted at 29 and 29\u0026#34; to the individual rails or members of the gate. The individual rails or members are also pivoted at 30 and 30 to depending members 31 and 31 which-are hinged at 32 and 32 to the cross-bar 2 of the frame, whereby said gate-sections are free to swing back and forth in addition to the movement to close the same together to raise them. To efiect this lever through the v mechanism similar to that shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is employed,  \n  that while in that form of structure a drum pull the cords 33 and shown in Fig. 1.  \n \u0026#39;sition, at the and cord were provided to raise the bands in the present form cords 33 and 33 are at- I tached at 34 and 34 to the bars 28 and 28 and pass over the pulley 7 to the arm 9 of the upper bell-crank lever.  \n  When the trip mechanism is actuated by the train, the system of bell-crank levers will be operated, as before described, and the I movement of the arm 9 of the upper one will 53 and raise the gatesections 26 and 26 folding the same together against the cross-beam 2.  \n p In Fig. 4 I have shown a special form of depending member which combines in itself a rigid or-flexible structure. It comprises a series of plates 35, which are hinged together at 36 and arepivotally hung at 37 from a hin e 38, which is secured to the cross-beam 20 the frame. These sections 35 are provided on one side with guides 40, and adapted to enter these guides is a jointed rod 41, to  \n which is attached a cord 42, whereby it may be raised as desired. When in the lowered position, the joints of this rod are opposite the joints of the several plates-or sections 35, so that the structure is entirely flexible, and when it is desired to raise the same it can be wound upon a suitable drum in the manner set forth with reference to the structure In this position also it 1 serves as a flexible structure not liable to injury by accidental contact with an animal driven on the track by mistake. When it is desired to form this bar into a stiff member, however, in order that it may be raised sid\u0026#39;ewise or folded, as desired, in the manner described with reference to the structure shown in Fig. 3, the cord 42, attached to the jointed rod 41, is pulled, which causes the joints of said rod to enter the guides on the side of said sections, thereby locking the several jointed plates or sections 35 together and preventing flexion of the bar when raised. A bar constructed in accordance with this idea forms in itself a stiff or flexible member, as desired.  \n  By means of suitable trip mechanism to operate the system of levers carried by the frame the gate or barrier will be placed in the active or-operative osition on the approach of the train from eit er direction, and as said train passes. it will engage other tripping mechanism, which will raise the gate or barrier and place the same in the inoperative posame time resetting the trip mechanism, so that itcan be operated bya train or other vehicle approaching from either side.  \n  Having thus claim and desire to secure cutdescribed my invention,l by Letters Pat- \u0026#39;posite positions after it 1. The combination in a gate or barrier to the movable element and the first-named bell-crank lever, mechanism actuated by the moving train for operating the first-named bell-crank lever, and means for holding said latter lever in its opposite positions.  \n  3.
